BRYANT DONALDSON, JR.\n\n                 Appeal from the Criminal Court for Wilson County\n                     No. 20-CR-119     Brody N.

After a sentencing hearing, the trial court\nimposed an effective twenty-three-year sentence. Defendant appeals, arguing that the trial\ncourt erred in admitting his psychosexual evaluation and a victim impact statement at\nsentencing and that the trial court misapplied enhancement factors. Upon our review of\nthe entire record, the briefs of the parties, and the applicable law, we affirm the judgments\nof the trial court.\n\n Tenn. R. App. P. 3 Appeal as of Right; Judgments of the Criminal Court Affirmed\n\nJILL BARTEE AYERS, J., delivered the opinion of the court, in which ROBERT L.\nHOLLOWAY, JR., and ROBERT H. MONTGOMERY, JR., JJ., joined.\n\nDaniel J. Turklay, Lebanon, Tennessee, for the appellant, Bryant Donaldson, Jr.\n\nJonathan Skrmetti, Attorney General and Reporter; Ryan Dugan, Assistant Attorney\nGeneral; Jason Lawson, District Attorney General; and Thomas Harwell Swink, Assistant\nDistrict Attorney General, for the appellee, State of Tennessee.\n\n                                        OPINION\n\n                          Factual and Procedural Background\n\n       On February 12, 2020, Defendant was indicted for one count of especially\naggravated sexual exploitation of a minor (count one), six counts of statutory rape by an\nauthority figure (counts two through seven), and six counts of aggravated statutory rape\n(counts eight through thirteen). The case proceeded to trial on July 27, 2021. After the\nState completed voir dire, a plea agreement was reached. Pursuant to the plea agreement,\n\fDefendant pled guilty to counts one and eight through thirteen in exchange for the dismissal\nof counts two through seven. The trial court would determine the length and manner of\nsentence. We note that the appellate record does not contain a transcript of trial\nproceedings or of Defendant\u2019s plea submission. See State v. Keen, 996 S.W.2d 842, 843-\n44 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1999) (\u201c[A] transcript of the guilty plea hearing is often (if not\nalways) needed in order to conduct a proper review of the sentence imposed.\u201d); Tenn. R.\nApp. P. 24(b) (stating that the appellant has the duty to prepare a record which conveys a\n\u201cfair, accurate and complete account of what transpired with respect to those issues that are\nthe bases of appeal\u201d). An appellate who fails to include the transcript of the guilty plea\nhearing in the record risks waiver of a sentencing issue. This court determines on a case-\nby-case basis whether the record is sufficient for meaningful review without the inclusion\nof the plea submission transcript. State v. Caudle, 388 S.W.3d 273, 279 (Tenn. 2012). In\nthis case, we will consider the merits of Defendant\u2019s sentencing issues because the facts of\nthe offense are sufficiently stated in the presentence report. The relevant facts underlying\nthe plea, as provided in the presentence report, are as follows:\n\n       On January 11, 2020, . . . officers with the Wilson County Sheriff\u2019s\n       Department were dispatched to [the victim\u2019s house regarding] a possible\n       rape. Detectives arrived at the residence, where the 14[-]year[-]old female\n       victim . . . resided with her mother and others, including the victim\u2019s 15[-\n       ]year[-]old sister and [Defendant]. Upon arrival detectives made contact\n       with the victim\u2019s mother, who[] advised that she had checked [the victim\u2019s]\n       phone and found a picture of a penis and a video of [the victim] in a sexual\n       act with [Defendant]. She advised that she recognized the location that the\n       video was taken as in the laundry room . . . . The phone was placed into\n       evidence and the laundry room photographed. At this time the victim was\n       being taken to [S]ummit [H]ospital by her grandmother. Detectives then\n       received a call from Summit Hospital Emergency Room nurse stating that\n       the victim was being transported to Our Kids (Nashville General Hospital)\n       to have a sexual assault kit conducted. After leaving [the victim\u2019s house],\n       deputies transported [Defendant] to the Sheriff\u2019s Department to be\n       interviewed. Detectives met with [Defendant] at the Sheriff\u2019s [D]epartment\n       and upon being advised of his rights[, Defendant] agreed to speak with\n       detectives. [Defendant] was asked about his relationship with the victim and\n       [Defendant] stated that \u201cshe looks up to him\u201d and that they just sit around\n       and talk. [Defendant] was then asked if he had had any sexual contact with\n       the victim and he denied having any sexual relationship with her. Detectives\n       explained the video evidence they ha[d] in which showed [Defendant] and\n       the victim engaging in a sexual act. [Defendant] denied a sexual act and\n       argued that detectives did not have a video of him. He stated that he has only\n       had a parenting[,] role model type relationship with the victim. Upon being\n                                            -2-\n\fasked if he had taken any type of drugs, [Defendant] stated that he takes drugs\non a daily basis and had used earlier the same day but would not elaborate\non what drugs he had taken. It was determined that the subject was under\nthe influence at that time and the interview was stopped. . . .\n\nOn January 13, 2020[,] the victim\u2019s mother stated to detectives that she had\njust found out that her other daughter (K.R.) had also been approached by\n[D]efendant in a sexual manner. A forensic interview was then conducted\nwith the victim at the child advocacy center on the date of January 13, 2020.\nDuring this interview the victim reported that she understood that she is here\nto talk about Bryant \u201cbubba\u201d Donaldson and what happened. She stated that\n[Defendant] is Sierra\u2019s brother (Sierra lives with them). She reported that\nthe incidents started around August of 2019 in which she and [Defendant]\nbegan talking as friends and about a month after things progressed. She\nstated that he would tell her that he loved her, wanted to marry her and have\nkids with her. She stated that a few days prior to the interview they had sex.\nShe stated that her mother went through her phone and found pictures and\nvideo of her and [Defendant]. She stated that her grandmother then drove\nher to Summit Hospital and then to Our Kids. She stated that the incident on\nSaturday was not the only time they had sex, the first time was around August\nor September 2019. She stated that [Defendant] would touch her body all\nover before they had sex (breasts, legs, vagina). She stated that the first time\nthey had sex was in the basement of her mother\u2019s house on the couch. After\nthey had sex, she stated that [Defendant] would digitally penetrate her\nvagina. She stated that he did not use protection when they had sex. She\nreported that they had sex multiple times. She stated that the first time they\nhad sex it did hurt her for a few seconds but did not hurt later. She stated\nthat on Saturday (January 11, 2020) they had sex with him penetrating her\nvaginally standing behind her with her hands on the wall. She stated that she\nperformed oral sex on [Defendant] twice, all incidents did occur in the\nbasement. She stated that everyone else was usually upstairs in the home\nwhen they had sex. When they had sex he would ejaculate both outside and\ninside of her. She stated that after the first time she told her sister (K.R.).\nLater on January 13, 2020[,] the victim\u2019s sister (K.R.) was interviewed at the\nchild advocacy center, with her mother present. K.R. stated that she has\nknown [Defendant] for approximately [ten] years and they refer to him as\n\u201cbubba.\u201d She reported that [Defendant] had moved in with them in June\n2019 but sometimes stays with his sister Brandy in Gordonsville. She stated\nthat [Defendant] does not have a phone, car or a job and is often at home\nwhen everyone else is gone. Upon being asked about the sleeping\narrangements of the household[,] K.R. states that he often slept in her\n                                     -3-\n\f      mother\u2019s room or downstairs in the basement. She stated that everyone else\n      slept in bedrooms on the main floor of the house. She was then asked about\n      the sexual incidents between her sister and [Defendant] and she stated that\n      she had not seen the incidents but described an incident in which the three of\n      them were downstairs and she could hear the victim and [Defendant]\n      whispering. Upon asking what they were whispering about[,] [Defendant]\n      told her that they were making a bet that on whether she (K.R.) would have\n      sex with him or with them. She states that she told them that she wouldn\u2019t\n      and they stopped discussing it. She states that [Defendant] told her that he\n      and the victim were \u201cinterrupted\u201d earlier that day and they were going to\n      finish. She then states that [Defendant] and the victim then went into the\n      victim\u2019s room to \u201cfinish.\u201d She states that this occurred about a week and a\n      half ago. She then spoke of another incident in which they were at\n      [Defendant]\u2019s sister\u2019s house in Gordonsville and she was babysitting his\n      sister\u2019s kids. She states that while they were there he typed \u201cwill you have\n      sex with me, I will give you money or something you want\u201d into his phone\n      and showed it to her. She stated that she again refused. She stated that these\n      were the only times he asked her to do it but that he frequently made \u201csly\n      comments\u201d about it to her. She stated that she had asked the victim about\n      her sexual relationship with [Defendant] and she states that the victim told\n      her that she (the victim) and [Defendant] had had sex \u201ctoo many times to\n      count.\u201d Interviewer then spoke to K.R. about the difficulties of this type of\n      interview and the importance for her to be open and honest and that she was\n      not in any kind of trouble. K.R. then stated that in that case, there was another\n      incident in which one day [Defendant] had yelled at her to come into the\n      laundry room that he had something to tell her and when she went in he began\n      kissing her and he put his hand down her pants and she told him to stop. On\n      May 25, 2020[,] the [Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (\u201cTBI\u201d)] crime lab\n      issued a report indicating their analysis of the sexual assault kit and report\n      revealed the . . . sperm found on the victim\u2019s labia and vaginal swabs were a\n      DNA match to [Defendant].\n\n       On March 21, 2022, the trial court conducted a sentencing hearing. Defendant\u2019s\npresentence report, which included the victim\u2019s mother\u2019s victim impact statement, was\nadmitted into evidence. As noted in the presentence report, Defendant reported that he\n\u201cwas out of [his] mind\u201d when the victim \u201capproached [him] and [he] allowed it to happen.\u201d\nThe report also showed a confirmed gang affiliation and Defendant\u2019s criminal history\nwhich included convictions for aggravated robbery and failure to appear. Regarding his\naggravated robbery conviction, Defendant was sentenced to eight years suspended to\nprobation; following two violations, his probation was revoked. Defendant reported his\nmental health as \u201cpoor\u201d and admitted to alcohol and drug problems. He first drank alcohol\n                                            -4-\n\fat age thirteen, used heroin from 2018 until his arrest in 2020, and used methamphetamine\nand marijuana from \u201c2007 / 2008 until his arrest in 2020.\u201d Defendant reported that his\ndrug and alcohol use contributed to his current charges. Defendant\u2019s Strong-R Risk and\nNeeds Assessment resulted in risk score of \u201chigh.\u201d\n\n       The State then read the victim\u2019s mother\u2019s victim impact statement into the record.\nIn the statement, the victim\u2019s mother expressed that Defendant had \u201ctaken [her] child\u2019s\ninnocence away\u201d and caused the victim to be \u201cfull of anger and rage and hate.\u201d The\nvictim\u2019s mother questioned whether Defendant had \u201cput together a big master plan to use\n[her] so [he] could get to [her] girls[.]\u201d She expressed her belief that this was not an isolated\nincident and \u201cpray[ed] . . . that no little girl is ever around\u201d Defendant again. The victim\u2019s\nmother requested Defendant receive the maximum sentence.\n\n       Defendant objected to the State\u2019s reading of the victim impact statement,\nacknowledging that the victim has a right to put a statement into the record but requesting\nthat the trial court \u201cnot consider any hearsay that was contained in the statement as\nsubstantive evidence against [Defendant], things that, you know, the child victim might\nhave said, you know, to the mother, specifically.\u201d The court noted the victim impact\nstatement had not been subjected to cross-examination and stated it would \u201cgrant it the\nweight it\u2019s due, based on what [it\u2019s] heard.\u201d\n\n       Defendant\u2019s psychosexual evaluation was also admitted into evidence. Defendant\nnoted that he had \u201cassumed\u201d that the doctor who conducted the evaluation would testify\nbut acknowledged that the report was likely admissible even without the doctor\u2019s\ntestimony. However, \u201cto the extent that [he was] wrong about that and the statute doesn\u2019t\nspecifically allow that in,\u201d Defendant maintained his objection to the admission of the\npsychosexual evaluation without an opportunity to cross-examine the doctor.\n\n       The psychosexual evaluation included information regarding Defendant\u2019s current\nmental status, his family and interpersonal relationships, academic and criminal history,\nand psychiatric and substance abuse history. It also included questionnaires, objective\ntesting, and tools to determine Defendant\u2019s risk to reoffend. According to Defendant\u2019s\nversion of events, the victim \u201cwas the aggressor\u201d and was \u201cthrowing herself\u201d at him until\n\u201ceventually [Defendant] gave in.\u201d Defendant stated that the victim performed oral sex on\nhim, but he denied sexual intercourse. He \u201cdismissed the DNA evidence as [in]valid\u201d and\nasserted the victim and witness statements were incorrect and the victim\u2019s mother \u201cgot\neverybody to go against\u201d him. Ultimately, the evaluating doctor determined that\nDefendant\u2019s risk for engaging in sexual misconduct was \u201cwell above average[.]\u201d\n\n      Brandi Donaldson, Defendant\u2019s sister, testified that she had witnessed the victim\nconsume alcohol, smoke marijuana, and make sexual advances on grown men. Ms.\n                                              -5-\n\fDonaldson stated that Defendant is \u201ca really good person\u201d who had not been given the\nchance he needs and \u201cfalls victim to trying to fit in and do what other people want from\nhim.\u201d Defendant introduced five certificates of completion for behavioral and Bible classes\nhe had obtained while incarcerated.\n\n       The trial court stated that it had considered the evidence at the sentencing hearing,\nthe presentence report, the principles of sentencing and arguments on sentencing\nalternatives, the nature of the criminal conduct, evidence regarding mitigating and\nenhancement factors, statistical information from the administrative office of the courts on\nsentencing and Defendant\u2019s potential for rehabilitation and treatment. It found Defendant\nto be a Range I standard offender and noted that count one was a non-probateable offense\nrequired to be served at 100%. The trial court found that mitigating factor one, that the\ncriminal conduct neither caused nor threatened serious bodily injury, applied but did not\n\u201cput a whole lot of weight on it.\u201d See T.C.A. \u00a7 40-35-113(1).\n\n        Regarding enhancement factors, the trial court \u201cput a great deal of credit\u201d on\nDefendant\u2019s conviction for failure to appear and \u201cextensive, long-term\u201d drug use because\n\u201cthe best predictor of future performances is past behavior[.]\u201d See id. \u00a7 -114(1) (\u201cThe\ndefendant has a previous history of criminal convictions or criminal behavior, in addition\nto those necessary to establish the appropriate range[.]\u201d). It also applied enhancement\nfactor seven, that the crime was committed to gratify Defendant\u2019s desire for pleasure and\nexcitement. See id. \u00a7 -114(7). The court noted that Defendant was in a sexual relationship\nwith the victim\u2019s mother, \u201ca willing sex partner that\u2019s more your age[,]\u201d when he undertook\nthis sexual relationship with \u201cthis child\u201d and ejaculated during the sexual encounter. Based\non Defendant\u2019s two prior probation violations, the trial court found that Defendant had\nfailed to comply with the conditions of a sentence involving release into the community.\nSee id. \u00a7 -114(8). Finally, the trial court found that Defendant violated a position of private\ntrust because Defendant was \u201cinvolved in a parental role for this child\u201d and the victim\u2019s\nmother \u201ctrusted [Defendant] enough to have him in the house\u201d with her children. See id.\n\u00a7 -114(14).\n\n        The trial court sentenced Defendant to eleven years for count one and four years\neach for counts eight through thirteen. After considering the \u201caggravating circumstances,\u201d\nit found that partial consecutive sentencing was appropriate because Defendant was\nconvicted of more than two offenses involving sexual abuse of a minor. See id. \u00a7 40-35-\n115(a)(5). It ordered that counts nine and ten be served consecutively to count one, and\nthat eight, eleven, twelve, and thirteen run concurrently with each other but consecutively\nto counts one, nine, and ten, for an effective sentence of twenty-three years.\n\n       On March 21, 2022, the trial court entered a written order containing its oral\nfindings. Defendant filed a timely motion for new trial on April 20, 2022, which was\n                                             -6-\n\fsubsequently amended on May 8, 2023. The trial court denied Defendant\u2019s motion for new\ntrial via written order on April 4, 2024.1 Defendant\u2019s timely appeal is now before this\ncourt.\n\n                                               Analysis\n\n                                     I. Admission of Evidence\n\n        On appeal, Defendant argues that the psychosexual evaluation and the victim impact\nstatement were inadmissible hearsay, and their admission at the sentencing hearing violated\nhis rights under the confrontation clause because the authors of the documents did not\ntestify. The State argues that the trial court properly admitted the psychosexual evaluation\nand the victim impact statement. We agree with the State.\n\n        Both the United States and Tennessee constitutions provide criminal defendants the\nright to confront witnesses against them. U.S. Const. amend. VI; Tenn. Const. art. I, \u00a7 9.\n\u201cThe admission of testimonial hearsay at trial, without a showing of unavailability and an\nopportunity to cross-examine, generally violates a defendant\u2019s right to confront adverse\nwitnesses.\u201d State v. Harris, No. M2008-01685-CCA-R3-CD, 2009 WL 1871919, at *6\n(Tenn. Crim. App. June 30, 2009) (citing Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 50 (2004)).\nHowever, this court has repeatedly held that \u201cthe Confrontation Clause is not applicable to\nsentencing hearings.\u201d State v. Bonds, 502 S.W.3d 118, 150 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2016) (first\nciting State v. Whited, No. E2013-02523-CCA-R3-CD, 2015 WL 2097843, at *10 (Tenn.\nCrim. App. May 4, 2015), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 506 S.W.3d 416 (Tenn. 2016); then\nciting State v. Boyd, No. W2009-00762-CCA-R3-CD, 2010 WL 1240720, at *8 (Tenn.\nCrim. App. Mar. 30, 2010); then citing Harris, 2009 WL 1871919, at *6; and then citing\nState v. Stephenson, 195 S.W.3d 574, 590 (Tenn. 2006), abrogated on other grounds by\nState v. Watkins, 362 S.W.3d 530 (Tenn. 2012)). Thus, Defendant\u2019s argument that the\nvictim impact statement and the psychosexual evaluation violated his rights under the\nconfrontation clause are unavailing.\n\n        The Tennessee Rules of Evidence apply at sentencing except that reliable hearsay\n\u201cmay be admitted if the opposing party is accorded a fair opportunity to rebut any hearsay\nevidence so admitted[.]\u201d T.C.A. \u00a7 40-35-209(b). Examples of reliable hearsay include\ncertified copies of convictions or documents and presentence reports. State v. Richmond,\nNo. M2021-01025-CCA-R3-CD, 2022 WL 4372220, at *11 (Tenn. Crim. App. Sept. 22,\n2022) (citing State v. Baker, 956 S.W.2d 8, 17 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1997)), no perm. app.\n\n   1\n     The reasons for the approximate one-year delay between the original and amended motion for new trial\nand the trial court\u2019s entry of a written order denying the motion are unclear from the record. However,\nneither party raises the issue on appeal.\n                                                  -7-\n\ffiled; see Jenkins v. State, E2010-00938-CCA-R3-PC, 2011 WL 810770, at *5 (Tenn.\nCrim. App. Mar. 9, 2011) (concluding that the petitioner could not establish prejudice\nstemming from counsel\u2019s failure to object to admission of the presentence report because\n\u201cit is settled law that the presentence report is reliable hearsay and is admissible during\nsentencing hearings\u201d).\n\n       When a defendant is convicted of a sex offense, which includes aggravated statutory\nrape, and is eligible for an alternative sentence, a psychosexual evaluation \u201cshall be\nincluded as part of the presentence report and shall be considered by the court[.]\u201d T.C.A.\n\u00a7 39-13-705(b) (emphasis added). Additionally, \u201c[p]rior to imposition of sentence in a\nfelony case, the department of correction shall prepare a written victim impact statement\nas part of the presentence report on the defendant.\u201d Id. \u00a7 40-38-205. Thus, both the\npsychosexual evaluation and the victim impact statement were part of the presentence\nreport, and the \u201ctrial court is entitled to rely on the presentence report \u2018absent a showing\nthat the report is based upon unreliable sources or is otherwise inaccurate.\u2019\u201d State v.\nRogers, No. W2021-00807-CCA-R3-CD, 2022 WL 2733698, at *9 (Tenn. Crim. App. July\n14, 2022) (quoting State v. Crossman, No. 01C01-9311-CR-00394, 1994 WL 548712, at\n*6 (Tenn. Crim. App. Oct. 6, 1994)), no perm. app. filed. Because the psychosexual\nevaluation and victim impact statement are not constitutionally prohibited and are\nexplicitly authorized by statute, such evidence is admissible so long as it is reliable, and\nDefendant was provided the opportunity to rebut the evidence. See State v. Moss, 13\nS.W.3d 374, 385 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1999); T.C.A. \u00a7 40-35-209(b).\n\n       The victim impact statement was attached to the presentence report. It included\nboth the Tennessee Department of Correction (\u201cTDOC\u201d) Victim Impact Statement form,\nwhich was filled out, signed, and dated by the victim\u2019s mother and a typed statement from\nthe victim\u2019s mother on a separate page. See Harris, 2009 WL 1871919, at *6 (citing State\nv. Garner, No. M1999-01427-CCA-R3-CD, 2000 WL 1681022, at *3 (Tenn. Crim. App.\nNov. 9, 2000)) (stating that a victim impact statement\u2019s inclusion in the presentence report\noperated to verify the hearsay\u2019s reliability). While the typed statement does not include\nthe victim\u2019s mother\u2019s name or signature, it does include the style of the case and the\nvictim\u2019s mother indicated on the TDOC form to \u201csee attached.\u201d Additionally, the\nsubstance of the typed statement makes clear the victim\u2019s mother wrote the statement. To\nthe extent the written statement included details of the circumstances surrounding the\noffenses, such details explained the impact of Defendant\u2019s crimes on the victim and her\nfamily. We conclude that the victim impact statement was sufficiently reliable and, thus,\nwas properly admitted and considered by the trial court.\n\n       Regarding the psychosexual evaluation, Defendant has presented no evidence that\nthe psychosexual evaluation contained inaccuracies or was otherwise unreliable. We note\nthat Defendant asserts in his brief that \u201cthere is nothing in the record authenticating [the\n                                           -8-\n\fpsychosexual evaluation] as actually being the full, final, and complete document[.]\u201d\nHowever, Defendant did not raise this objection at sentencing or in his motion for new\ntrial. Thus, Defendant has waived any objection to the authenticity of the psychosexual\nevaluation. See Tenn. R. App. P. 36(a) (\u201cNothing in this rule shall be construed as requiring\nrelief be granted to a party responsible for an error or who failed to take whatever action\nwas reasonably available to prevent or nullify the harmful effect of an error.\u201d); State v.\nAvila-Salazar, No. M2023-01649-CCA-R3-CD, 2024 WL 3738647, at *2 (Tenn. Crim.\nApp. Aug. 9, 2024) (stating that a party cannot raise an issue for the first time or change\ntheir argument on appeal), perm. app. denied (Tenn. Jan. 24, 2025). The trial court did not\nerr in admitting and considering the psychosexual evaluation because the right to confront\nwitnesses does not extend to sentencing proceedings, and the trial court was required to\nconsider the psychosexual evaluation in sentencing Defendant for counts eight through\nthirteen.\n\n        Defendant is not entitled to relief on this basis.\n\n                                        II. Enhancement Factors\n\n        Defendant argues that the trial court erred by applying enhancement factors seven\nand fourteen because there was no evidence that the offenses were committed to satisfy\nDefendant\u2019s desire for pleasure and excitement other than the inherent sexual nature of\nDefendant\u2019s crimes or that he abused a position of private trust. 2 The State asserts that the\ntrial court properly applied these factors, and in the alternative, any error was harmless\nbecause the trial court imposed a within-range sentence after applying two unchallenged\nenhancement factors. We agree with the State.\n\n       On appeal, the party challenging the sentence bears the burden of establishing that\nthe sentence is improper. State v. Branham, 501 S.W.3d 577, 595 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2016).\nThis court reviews sentencing decisions under an \u201cabuse of discretion standard of review,\ngranting a presumption of reasonableness to within-range sentencing decisions that reflect\na proper application of the purposes and principles of our Sentencing Act.\u201d State v. Bise,\n380 S.W.3d 682, 707 (Tenn. 2012). \u201cA trial court abuses its discretion when it applies\nincorrect legal standards, reaches an illogical conclusion, bases its ruling on a clearly\nerroneous assessment of the proof, or applies reasoning that causes an injustice to the\ncomplaining party.\u201d State v. Phelps, 329 S.W.3d 436, 443 (Tenn. 2010) (citing State v.\nJordan, 325 S.W.3d 1, 38-40 (Tenn. 2010)).\n\n\n   2\n     In his brief, Defendant directs this court\u2019s attention to enhancement factors seven and fourteen but fails\nto include proper citation to the applicable statute or any case law in support of his position. While\nDefendant\u2019s omission has not frustrated this court\u2019s review, we reiterate the importance of including proper\nauthority in support of legal arguments. See Tenn. R. App. P. 27(a)(7)(a); Tenn. Ct. Crim. App. 10(b).\n                                                    -9-\n\f       Once a trial court determines the appropriate range of punishment, the trial court\nmust consider: (1) the evidence received at trial and the sentencing hearing; (2) the\npresentence report, including a validated risk and needs assessment; (3) any arguments as\nto sentencing alternatives; (4) the nature and characteristics of the criminal conduct; (5)\nany applicable mitigating and enhancement factors; (6) any statement the defendant makes\non his behalf; and (7) statistical information provided by the administrative office of the\ncourts as to sentencing practices for similar offenses in Tennessee. T.C.A. \u00a7 40-35-210(a),\n(b). Additionally, the sentence imposed should be \u201cno greater than that deserved for the\noffense committed\u201d and \u201cthe least severe measure necessary to achieve the purposes for\nwhich the sentence was imposed.\u201d Id. at \u00a7 40-35-103(2), (4).\n\n       When adjusting the length of a sentence within the appropriate range, a trial court\nis guided by, but not bound by, any applicable mitigating and enhancement factors. State\nv. Mosley, No. W2022-01424-CCA-R3-CD, 2024 WL 1406156, at *21 (Tenn. Crim. App.\nApr. 2, 2024) (quoting Bise, 380 S.W.3d at 706), perm. app. denied (Tenn. July 17, 2024).\nIt is within the trial court\u2019s sound discretion to weigh any applicable mitigating or\nenhancement factors. State v. Nelson, No. M2023-00176-CCA-R3-CD, 2024 WL\n1192985, at *15 (Tenn. Crim. App. Mar. 20, 2024) (quoting State v. Carter, 254 S.W.3d\n335, 345 (Tenn. 2007)), no perm. app. filed. Thus, \u201ca trial court\u2019s misapplication of an\nenhancement or mitigating factor does not invalidate the sentence imposed unless the trial\ncourt wholly departed\u201d from the sentencing act. Bise, 380 S.W.3d at 706.\n\n        Here, the trial court found that Defendant was a Range I, standard offender. See\nT.C.A. \u00a7 40-35-105. The trial court imposed within-range sentences for each conviction.\nSee id. \u00a7 -112(a)(2), (a)(4) (mandating that a Range I sentence be between eight and twelve\nyears for a Class B felony and between two and four years for a Class D felony).\nAdditionally, the trial court imposed partial consecutive sentencing. See id. \u00a7 -115(a)(5).\nDefendant does not challenge the manner or alignment of his sentences, and thus, this court\nwill focus solely on his challenge to the trial court\u2019s application of enhancement factors\nseven and fourteen.\n\n        Defendant asserts that, in applying enhancement factor seven, the trial court\nimproperly relied on the sexual nature of the offenses. Under Tennessee Code Annotated\nsection 40-35-114(7), a trial court may enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence within the\nappropriate range if it finds that the \u201coffense involved a victim and was committed to\ngratify the defendant\u2019s desire for pleasure or excitement[.]\u201d This factor may not be applied\nto sexual offenses that require proof of motive, such as sexual battery, but may be applied\nto sexual offenses that require no proof of motive, such as rape. State v. Kissinger, 922\nS.W.2d 482, 489-90 (Tenn. 1996) (noting that sexual battery requires proof that the\ndefendant made sexual contact, which is defined as intentional touching \u201cfor the purpose\nof sexual arousal or gratification\u201d). Neither especially aggravated sexual exploitation nor\n                                           - 10 -\n\faggravated statutory rape require proof of motive. See T.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 39-13-506(a), -17-\n1005(a), -17-1002(10).\n\n       \u201cEssential to proper application of this factor is the determination of the defendant\u2019s\nmotive for committing the offense.\u201d State v. Osborne, 251 S.W.3d 1, 26 (Tenn. Crim. App.\n2007) (citing State v. Arnett, 49 S.W.3d 250, 261 (Tenn. 2001)). The State must provide\n\u201cobjective evidence of the defendant\u2019s motivation to seek pleasure or excitement\u201d which\nmay include evidence of \u201csexually explicit remarks and overt sexual displays made by the\ndefendant, such as fondling or kissing a victim or otherwise behaving in a sexual\nmanner[.]\u201d State v. Tice, No. M2021-00495-CCA-R3-CD, 2022 WL 2800876, at *52\n(Tenn. Crim. App. July 18, 2022) (quoting Arnett, 49 S.W.3d at 262), perm. app. denied\n(Tenn. Dec. 14, 2022). The fact that the defendant orgasmed is insufficient, without more,\nto prove the existence of this factor. Kissinger, 922 S.W.2d at 491. \u201cThus, while this factor\ncan apply in a sexual offense, it must be shown that the circumstances surrounding the\noffense go beyond that which one would normally associate with sexual acts.\u201d State v.\nAllen, No. M2005-02808-CCA-R3-CD, 2006 WL 2380613, at *4 (Tenn. Crim. App. Aug.\n16, 2006).\n\n        Here, the trial court applied enhancement factor seven, finding that Defendant\nejaculated during the events and was in a relationship with the victim\u2019s mother. It\nexpressed confusion as to why Defendant entered a sexual relationship with the victim\ndespite having a consensual sexual relationship with the victim\u2019s mother. Further, the trial\ncourt considered the presentence report which established that the victim had told her sister\nthat she and Defendant had sex \u201ctoo many times to count,\u201d Defendant would \u201ctouch her\nbody all over before they had sex (breasts, legs, vagina),\u201d and Defendant told the victim he\nloved her and wanted to marry and have children with her. The victim also reported that\nafter she and Defendant had sex, he would insert his finger into her vagina. See State v.\nYelton, No. E2018-01436-CCA-R3-CD, 2019 WL 2475171, at *8 (Tenn. Crim. App. June\n13, 2019) (affirming application of enhancement factor seven because the \u201cevidence\npresented at trial and in the presentence report established that the [d]efendant kissed the\nvictim, fondled her breasts and buttocks, and inserted his finger into her vagina\u201d). The\nvictim\u2019s fifteen-year-old sister described when Defendant and the victim \u201cwere making a\nbet\u201d about whether the victim\u2019s sister would sleep with Defendant, a separate incident\nwhen Defendant sexually assaulted the victim\u2019s sister, and another incident when\nDefendant again propositioned the victim\u2019s minor sister, all of which support a finding that\nDefendant sought sexual interactions from the young girls to satisfy his desire for pleasure\nand excitement. The evidence supports the trial court\u2019s application of enhancement factor\nseven.\n\n       Next, Defendant contends that the trial court erred by applying enhancement factor\nfourteen. He notes that the State ultimately dismissed counts two through seven, and thus,\n                                            - 11 -\n\fDefendant \u201cdid not admit, even through virtue of his guilty plea, that he abused a position\nof public or private trust.\u201d Under Tennessee Code Annotated section 40-35-114(14), a trial\ncourt may enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence if the defendant abused a position of private trust\nin the commission of the offense. \u201c[A]pplication of the factor requires a finding, first, that\ndefendant occupied a position of trust\u201d and then a determination of \u201cwhether the position\noccupied was abused by the commission of the offense.\u201d Kissinger, 922 S.W.2d at 488.\nThe position of private trust is dependent on the nature of the relationship, not on the\nformality, and our supreme court has noted that the positions of \u201cparent, step-parent,\nbabysitter, teacher, [and] coach\u201d are a few \u201cobvious examples.\u201d Id. An adult who lives\nwith a minor \u201coccupies a position of \u2018presumptive private trust\u2019 with respect to the minor.\u201d\nState v. Gutierrez, 5 S.W.3d 641, 645 (Tenn. 1999).\n\n       Here, the trial court found that Defendant abused a position of private trust because\nDefendant told law enforcement that he occupied a \u201cparental role\u201d for the victim. The trial\ncourt further noted that Defendant lived in the home with the victim, dated and engaged in\na sexual relationship with the victim\u2019s mother, and the victim\u2019s mother \u201ctrusted him to\nleave the [victim] alone with him.\u201d These findings are more than adequately supported by\nthe record, particularly the presentence report which noted that Defendant stated that the\nvictim \u201clooked up to him,\u201d as well as the victim\u2019s sister\u2019s statement about the length of\ntime the family had known Defendant. See Kissinger, 922 S.W.2d at 489 (finding that the\ndefendant occupied a position of private trust because he had a long friendship with the\nvictims\u2019 mother and the victims\u2019 mother trusted him with the care of the boys); State v.\nChaves-Abrego, No. M2019-01686-CCA-R3-CD, 2021 WL 50252, at *9 (Tenn. Crim.\nApp. Jan. 6, 2021) (upholding trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant \u201cwas in a position of\nprivate trust with the victims\u2019 parents and that he abused that position of private trust\u201d\nwithout regard to whether the defendant was in a position of private trust with the minor\nvictims). The evidence supports the trial court\u2019s application of enhancement factor\nfourteen.\n\n        Finally, we note that even had we determined that the trial court erred in the\napplication of either or both enhancement factors discussed above, the trial court applied\ntwo other enhancement factors Defendant does not challenge. See State v. Ambrose, No.\nM2023-00097-CCA-R3-CD, 2024 WL 3596231, at *10 (Tenn. Crim. App. July 31, 2024)\n(citing State v. Dotson, 450 S.W.3d 1, 103 (Tenn. 2014)) (noting that \u201cthe application of a\nsingle enhancement factor supports an enhanced sentence\u201d), perm. app. denied (Tenn.

J.\n          Plaintiffs 1448 28th Avenue, LLC and Santino\nFilipelli, the LLC\u2019s sole member, appeal from a judgment\nof the trial court dismissing for lack of jurisdiction their\ndeclaratory judgment action against the City of Portland,\nwhich challenged the city\u2019s failure to grant a final certificate\nof occupancy for a commercial space owned by plaintiffs. We\nconclude that the trial court did not err and therefore affirm.\n         Plaintiffs own a two-story mixed-use building in\nNortheast Portland. The ground floor is commercial, and\nthe second floor is residential. Plaintiffs obtained a permit\nfrom the city for a remodel of the ground-floor commercial\nspace. The permit was conditioned upon plaintiffs\u2019 removal\nof a driveway adjacent to the building that was not in com-\npliance with the city\u2019s safety standards.\n         Plaintiffs remodeled the commercial space but\ndid not remove the driveway, and the city has withheld a\nfinal occupancy permit for the commercial space until the\ndriveway is removed. Plaintiffs challenge the city\u2019s deci-\nsion through this action for declaratory judgment. The\ntrial court dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 action, determining that\nit lacked jurisdiction over plaintiffs\u2019 declaratory judgment\naction, because a writ of review was the exclusive form of\nchallenge to the city\u2019s decision.

City of Portland, 306 Or 444, 448,\n760 P2d 252 (1988); Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers, 287 Or at\n602-03. In Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers, the court described\ncharacteristics that identify an adjudicative action:\n      \u201cGenerally, to characterize a process as an adjudication pre-\n      supposes that the process is bound to result in a decision and\n      that the decision is bound to apply preexisting criteria to con-\n      crete facts. * * * [A] further consideration has been whether\n      the action, even when the governing criteria leave much room\n      for policy discretion, is directed at a closely circumscribed\n      factual situation or a relatively small number of persons.\u201d\nId.\n        Our caselaw has come to recognize Strawberry Hill\n4 Wheelers as identifying three considerations that bear on\nthe determination whether a local government\u2019s process is\nadjudicative and therefore subject to a writ of review:\n     \u2022   Does the process, once begun, call for reaching a deci-\n         sion confined by preexisting criteria rather than by a\n         wide discretionary choice of action or inaction?\n     \u2022   To what extent is the decision-maker bound to apply\n         preexisting criteria to concrete facts?\n     \u2022   To what extent is the decision directed at a closely cir-\n         cumscribed factual situation or a relatively small num-\n         ber of persons?\nDodds, 222 Or App at 133 (noting that, in Strawberry Hill 4\nWheelers, \u201cthe Supreme Court explained that quasi-judicial\n\fCite as 339 Or App 27 (2025)                                                   31\n\ndecisions subject to writ of review are those processes that\nmeet three criteria\u201d); see also Hood River Valley v.

The\nthree considerations do not describe fixed elements of a quasi-\njudicial function but \u201ccharacteristics that might indicate that\na disputed action or decision-making process was judicial or\nquasi-judicial, as opposed to ministerial or legislative.\u201d Lane,\n310 Or App at 303-04 (quoting Hicks v. Central Point Sch. Dist.,\n270 Or App 532, 544, 348 P3d 307, rev den, 357 Or 743 (2015)).\nIf the writ-of-review process is available, the writ-of-review\nstatutes bar claims for declaratory or injunctive relief. ORS\n34.102 (stating that, if a writ of review is available, then the\ndecision must be reviewed under ORS 34.010 to ORS 34.102).\n         The determination whether the writ of review\nprocess was available here depends on whether the city\u2019s\naction was adjudicative, within the meaning of the term as\ndescribed in Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers. We therefore con-\nsider in more detail the largely undisputed facts giving rise\nto the current dispute.\n          It is undisputed that plaintiffs requested a permit\nfor the remodel of the ground-level commercial space of 1448\n28th Avenue. The materials submitted by plaintiffs did not\nrefer to a driveway and, on the submitted drawings, the area\nwhere the driveway curb cut sits was labeled \u201cwood fence.\u201d\n         The record shows that the city\u2019s actions consisted\nof the following: As required by Title 17 of the Portland\nCity Code (PCC), plaintiffs\u2019 application was reviewed by the\nPortland Bureau of Development Services (BDS) and Bureau\nof Transportation (PBOT). The review revealed a driveway\nand curb cut on plaintiffs\u2019 site and adjacent to the side of\nplaintiffs\u2019 building that did not comply with the PCC.1 In\n   1\n     PCC 17.28.110 provides, as relevant:\n       \u201cA. Purpose. Ensure that driveway locations promote the safe and\n   orderly flow of pedestrians, bicycles, and vehicular traffic, preserve on-street\n   parking, preserve or establish street trees, maximize opportunities for veg-\n   etated stormwater management, reduce conflicts with pedestrians and bicy-\n   cles and enhance the pedestrian environment.\n       \u201c* * * * *\n       \u201cC. Driveway definition: For the purposes of this Code section, a drive-\n   way is a gravel or paved way for vehicular traffic extending from the roadway\n\f32                      1448 28th Avenue, LLC v. City of Portland\n\nparticular, the driveway was closer than 25 feet from the\nintersection of NE 28th Avenue and NE Halsey Avenue.\nIt did not permit vehicles to exit in a forward motion, as\nrequired by the PCC for NE 28th Avenue, a \u201ccollector\u201d street.\nIn addition, the driveway was \u201ctoo narrow for modern vehic-\nular circulation under Portland City Code Requirements,\u201d\nhad a \u201cblind corner nearby,\u201d and was adjacent to \u201can inter-\nsection that has known safety problems\u201d and a \u201chistory of\ntraffic crashes going back many years.\u201d In fact, the driveway\ndid not meet the PCC definition of a \u201cdriveway,\u201d because it\ndid not access parking. Indeed, plaintiffs\u2019 application did not\neven identify the driveway; the curb cut area was labeled as\na \u201cwood fence.\u201d\n          Because plaintiffs\u2019 driveway was in violation of the\nPCC, plaintiffs\u2019 building-permit application triggered the\ncity to require either the removal or modification of the drive-\nway. Plaintiffs could have challenged the city\u2019s determina-\ntion through a driveway-design exception but they chose not\nto do so. And plaintiffs were not interested in attempting\nto modify the driveway. Instead, plaintiffs agreed to add a\ncurb to close the driveway. They completed an application\nfor a \u201cminor improvement permit,\u201d which allows them to add\na curb, so that the permitting process could continue. With\nthe addition of a curb as a condition, the city approved a per-\nmit for the remodel.\n        Several months later, plaintiffs sought a final occu-\npancy permit. But plaintiffs had not constructed the curb to\n     to the adjacent property line(s) for the purpose of providing access to parking\n     as provided under PCC Chapter 33.266.\n         \u201cD. Reconstruction and Revocation of Existing Driveways.\n         \u201c1. The Director of the Bureau of Transportation may revoke any drive-\n     way permit or require the modification of any driveway if:\n         \u201ca. The area occupied by the driveway is needed for right-of-way pur-\n     poses; or\n         \u201cb. Continued operation of the driveway interferes with the safe and\n     orderly flow of pedestrians, bicycles or vehicular traffic; or\n         \u201cc. The abutting owner has failed to comply with all specifications and\n     conditions of the permit; or\n         \u201cd. The driveway does not access a legal parking space on abutting prop-\n     erty per PCC Title 33.\n         \u201c2. The Council may revoke any driveway permit if it deems such action\n     will be in the public interest.\u201d\n\fCite as 339 Or App 27 (2025)                                      33\n\nclose the driveway, as permitted by the minor improvement\npermit. As a result, the city denied the request for a final\noccupancy permit, citing the permit\u2019s condition for removal\nof the driveway. In a letter to plaintiffs\u2019 legal counsel, the\ncity attorney explained:\n   \u201cThe applicant acquired a minor improvement permit to close\n   the driveway with this remodel work as a condition of PBOT\n   approving the building permit. This driveway closure con-\n   tinues to be required and final occupancy will not be issued\n   until such time as this driveway is permanently closed.\u201d\n         Plaintiffs objected, contending that the \u201chistoric res-\nidential driveway\u201d should not even have come into consider-\nation, because its use was only by the second-floor residential\nspace, which was not implicated by the remodeled ground-\nlevel commercial space. The city responded that it does not\nmatter which portion of the structure is being remodeled or\nwhether the space is commercial or residential\u2014the city\u2019s\nfocus for the driveway requirement is on the site, not the var-\nious uses of the site. And the city explained that, although\nthe city has authority under the PCC to require the removal\nor upgrade of any nonconforming driveway at any time (even\none that is \u201chistoric\u201d), its policy is to wait until a permit is\nsought for a development of the property before requiring an\nupgrade or removal of a nonconforming driveway.\n         Plaintiffs disagreed and chose to file this declar-\natory judgment action, which, as noted, the trial court\nrejected, concluding that it lacked jurisdiction. Plaintiffs\u2019\nprimary arguments under their single assignment of error\nare that the actions of the city on plaintiffs\u2019 permit were not\nquasi-judicial under the Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers criteria\nand, further, that the \u201chistoric residential driveway\u201d was\nnot implicated by the remodel of the commercial space.\n         The city responds that the city\u2019s decision to decline\nto issue the permanent occupancy permit until the driveway\nis removed falls within the quasi-judicial category described\nin Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers, and we agree.\n        We address each of the criteria.\n        Does the process, once begun, call for reaching a\ndecision confined by preexisting criteria rather than by a\n\f34                      1448 28th Avenue, LLC v. City of Portland\n\nwide discretionary choice of action or inaction? Plaintiffs\nrequested a final certificate of occupancy. The request would\neither be approved or denied and was thus bound to result in\na decision. And the city\u2019s decision to deny the request pend-\ning removal of the driveway was confined by preexisting cri-\nteria\u2014those rules set forth in the PCC relating to noncon-\nforming driveways and established city policy that upgrades\nto or removal of nonconforming driveways would be required\nupon application for development of a property.\n         To what extent is the decision-maker bound to apply\npreexisting criteria to concrete facts? The undisputed record\nshows that the city has fixed procedures and criteria that it\napplies in evaluating development permits and that, in mak-\ning the decision that plaintiffs were required to remove the\ndriveway before a final certificate of occupancy would be\nissued, the city applied those preexisting criteria, including\nthe rules set forth in the PCC. The undisputed record further\nshows that, in making the decision that the driveway must\nbe removed, the city made its determination based on undis-\nputed concrete facts.\n         To what extent is the decision directed at a closely\ncircumscribed factual situation or a relatively small number\nof persons? Plaintiffs concede that the city\u2019s decision was\ndirected at a closely circumscribed factual situation and a\nrelatively small number of persons.\n         The considerations identified by the Supreme Court\nin Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers each weigh in favor of a deter-\nmination that the city\u2019s action was \u201cadjudicative\u201d or quasi-\njudicial. The record further persuades us that the city\u2019s\naction falls within the adjudicative or quasi-judicial category\ndescribed in Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers and was therefore\nsubject to writ of review. For that reason, we conclude that\nthe trial court did not err in determining that it lacked juris-\ndiction to consider plaintiffs\u2019 declaratory judgment action.2\n           Affirmed.\n\n     2\n       Because we conclude that the trial court did not err in dismissing plaintiffs\u2019\ndeclaratory judgment claim for lack of jurisdiction, we need not address plain-\ntiffs\u2019 argument that the remodel of the commercial space did not implicate the\n\u201chistoric residential driveway.\u201d\n\f",

We\nconclude that the trial court did not err and therefore affirm.\n         Plaintiffs own a two-story mixed-use building in\nNortheast Portland. The ground floor is commercial, and\nthe second floor is residential. Plaintiffs obtained a permit\nfrom the city for a remodel of the ground-floor commercial\nspace.

Plaintiffs challenge the city\u2019s deci-\nsion through this action for declaratory judgment. The\ntrial court dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 action, determining that\nit lacked jurisdiction over plaintiffs\u2019 declaratory judgment\naction, because a writ of review was the exclusive form of\nchallenge to the city\u2019s decision.

ORS\n34.102 (stating that, if a writ of review is available, then the\ndecision must be reviewed under ORS 34.010 to ORS 34.102).\n         The determination whether the writ of review\nprocess was available here depends on whether the city\u2019s\naction was adjudicative, within the meaning of the term as\ndescribed in Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers. We therefore con-\nsider in more detail the largely undisputed facts giving rise\nto the current dispute.\n          It is undisputed that plaintiffs requested a permit\nfor the remodel of the ground-level commercial space of 1448\n28th Avenue. The materials submitted by plaintiffs did not\nrefer to a driveway and, on the submitted drawings, the area\nwhere the driveway curb cut sits was labeled \u201cwood fence.\u201d\n         The record shows that the city\u2019s actions consisted\nof the following: As required by Title 17 of the Portland\nCity Code (PCC), plaintiffs\u2019 application was reviewed by the\nPortland Bureau of Development Services (BDS) and Bureau\nof Transportation (PBOT). The review revealed a driveway\nand curb cut on plaintiffs\u2019 site and adjacent to the side of\nplaintiffs\u2019 building that did not comply with the PCC.1 In\n   1\n     PCC 17.28.110 provides, as relevant:\n       \u201cA. Purpose. Ensure that driveway locations promote the safe and\n   orderly flow of pedestrians, bicycles, and vehicular traffic, preserve on-street\n   parking, preserve or establish street trees, maximize opportunities for veg-\n   etated stormwater management, reduce conflicts with pedestrians and bicy-\n   cles and enhance the pedestrian environment.\n       \u201c* * * * *\n       \u201cC. Driveway definition: For the purposes of this Code section, a drive-\n   way is a gravel or paved way for vehicular traffic extending from the roadway\n\f32                      1448 28th Avenue, LLC v. City of Portland\n\nparticular, the driveway was closer than 25 feet from the\nintersection of NE 28th Avenue and NE Halsey Avenue.\nIt did not permit vehicles to exit in a forward motion, as\nrequired by the PCC for NE 28th Avenue, a \u201ccollector\u201d street.\nIn addition, the driveway was \u201ctoo narrow for modern vehic-\nular circulation under Portland City Code Requirements,\u201d\nhad a \u201cblind corner nearby,\u201d and was adjacent to \u201can inter-\nsection that has known safety problems\u201d and a \u201chistory of\ntraffic crashes going back many years.\u201d In fact, the driveway\ndid not meet the PCC definition of a \u201cdriveway,\u201d because it\ndid not access parking. Indeed, plaintiffs\u2019 application did not\neven identify the driveway; the curb cut area was labeled as\na \u201cwood fence.\u201d\n          Because plaintiffs\u2019 driveway was in violation of the\nPCC, plaintiffs\u2019 building-permit application triggered the\ncity to require either the removal or modification of the drive-\nway. Plaintiffs could have challenged the city\u2019s determina-\ntion through a driveway-design exception but they chose not\nto do so. And plaintiffs were not interested in attempting\nto modify the driveway. Instead, plaintiffs agreed to add a\ncurb to close the driveway. They completed an application\nfor a \u201cminor improvement permit,\u201d which allows them to add\na curb, so that the permitting process could continue. With\nthe addition of a curb as a condition, the city approved a per-\nmit for the remodel.\n        Several months later, plaintiffs sought a final occu-\npancy permit. But plaintiffs had not constructed the curb to\n     to the adjacent property line(s) for the purpose of providing access to parking\n     as provided under PCC Chapter 33.266.\n         \u201cD.

As a result, the city denied the request for a final\noccupancy permit, citing the permit\u2019s condition for removal\nof the driveway. In a letter to plaintiffs\u2019 legal counsel, the\ncity attorney explained:\n   \u201cThe applicant acquired a minor improvement permit to close\n   the driveway with this remodel work as a condition of PBOT\n   approving the building permit. This driveway closure con-\n   tinues to be required and final occupancy will not be issued\n   until such time as this driveway is permanently closed.\u201d\n         Plaintiffs objected, contending that the \u201chistoric res-\nidential driveway\u201d should not even have come into consider-\nation, because its use was only by the second-floor residential\nspace, which was not implicated by the remodeled ground-\nlevel commercial space. The city responded that it does not\nmatter which portion of the structure is being remodeled or\nwhether the space is commercial or residential\u2014the city\u2019s\nfocus for the driveway requirement is on the site, not the var-\nious uses of the site. And the city explained that, although\nthe city has authority under the PCC to require the removal\nor upgrade of any nonconforming driveway at any time (even\none that is \u201chistoric\u201d), its policy is to wait until a permit is\nsought for a development of the property before requiring an\nupgrade or removal of a nonconforming driveway.\n         Plaintiffs disagreed and chose to file this declar-\natory judgment action, which, as noted, the trial court\nrejected, concluding that it lacked jurisdiction. Plaintiffs\u2019\nprimary arguments under their single assignment of error\nare that the actions of the city on plaintiffs\u2019 permit were not\nquasi-judicial under the Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers criteria\nand, further, that the \u201chistoric residential driveway\u201d was\nnot implicated by the remodel of the commercial space.\n         The city responds that the city\u2019s decision to decline\nto issue the permanent occupancy permit until the driveway\nis removed falls within the quasi-judicial category described\nin Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers, and we agree.\n        We address each of the criteria.\n        Does the process, once begun, call for reaching a\ndecision confined by preexisting criteria rather than by a\n\f34                      1448 28th Avenue, LLC v. City of Portland\n\nwide discretionary choice of action or inaction? Plaintiffs\nrequested a final certificate of occupancy. The request would\neither be approved or denied and was thus bound to result in\na decision. And the city\u2019s decision to deny the request pend-\ning removal of the driveway was confined by preexisting cri-\nteria\u2014those rules set forth in the PCC relating to noncon-\nforming driveways and established city policy that upgrades\nto or removal of nonconforming driveways would be required\nupon application for development of a property.\n         To what extent is the decision-maker bound to apply\npreexisting criteria to concrete facts? The undisputed record\nshows that the city has fixed procedures and criteria that it\napplies in evaluating development permits and that, in mak-\ning the decision that plaintiffs were required to remove the\ndriveway before a final certificate of occupancy would be\nissued, the city applied those preexisting criteria, including\nthe rules set forth in the PCC. The undisputed record further\nshows that, in making the decision that the driveway must\nbe removed, the city made its determination based on undis-\nputed concrete facts.\n         To what extent is the decision directed at a closely\ncircumscribed factual situation or a relatively small number\nof persons? Plaintiffs concede that the city\u2019s decision was\ndirected at a closely circumscribed factual situation and a\nrelatively small number of persons.\n         The considerations identified by the Supreme Court\nin Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers each weigh in favor of a deter-\nmination that the city\u2019s action was \u201cadjudicative\u201d or quasi-\njudicial. The record further persuades us that the city\u2019s\naction falls within the adjudicative or quasi-judicial category\ndescribed in Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers and was therefore\nsubject to writ of review. For that reason, we conclude that\nthe trial court did not err in determining that it lacked juris-\ndiction to consider plaintiffs\u2019 declaratory judgment action.2\n           Affirmed.\n\n     2\n       Because we conclude that the trial court did not err in dismissing plaintiffs\u2019\ndeclaratory judgment claim for lack of jurisdiction, we need not address plain-\ntiffs\u2019 argument that the remodel of the commercial space did not implicate the\n\u201chistoric residential driveway.\u201d\n\f</pre>",

On the first day of trial, plaintiff,\nappearing pro se, informed the court that he intended to\npursue only the unpaid wages claim and wanted to drop the\nother claims. Trial was held on the unpaid wages claim, and\nthe court sitting as factfinder found in defendant\u2019s favor. All\nclaims were then dismissed with prejudice. Defendant filed\nan attorney fee statement, summarily asserting a right to\nfees and costs under \u201cORS 659A.885(8)(e), ORS 652.200, and\nORS 20.107.\u201d1 Plaintiff made no objection to the fee state-\nment. As part of its general judgment, the court awarded\n$37,343.08 in attorney fees and costs to defendant, which\nwas the full amount requested. The court did not identify\nthe statutory bases for the fee award, nor did it make any\nfindings.\n         On appeal, plaintiff raises three assignments of\nerror, all relating to the fee award. In his first assignment\nof error, plaintiff argues that the court erred in awarding\nfees on the wage claim. He assumes that the court did not\naward fees under the statute cited in the fee statement, ORS\n652.200, because it applies only to prevailing plaintiffs, and\ninstead awarded fees under ORS 20.105\u2014a statute never\nmentioned in the trial court but that provides for a fee award\nin a civil action if there \u201cwas no objectively reasonable basis\nfor asserting the claim\u201d\u2014and argues why it was error to do\nso. In response, defendant argues that it could have been\nawarded fees under ORS 653.055(4), another statute never\nmentioned below. In his second and third assignments of\nerror, plaintiff argues that the court\u2019s findings are inade-\nquate for meaningful appellate review.\n         It is true that the trial court\u2019s findings are inade-\nquate for meaningful appellate review. See Northwest Pump\n& Equipment Co. v. Stach, 167 Or App 64, 69, 1 P3d 466\n(2000) (\u201cWhile Oregon courts have broad discretion in setting\n    1\n      ORS 20.107 and ORS 659A.885(8)(e) pertain to discrimination claims. ORS\n652.200 pertains to claims for unpaid wages upon termination.\n\f224              Abualya v. All Stop Pipes and Tobacco LLC\n\nattorney fees, the Supreme Court nonetheless requires them\nto enter findings that are sufficient to permit meaningful\nappellate review of their awards.\u201d). It is also true that the\nfee award on the wage claim is potentially problematic, inso-\nfar as the only statute cited as a basis for awarding fees on\nthat claim was a statute that, on its face, did not apply. See\nORS 652.200(1) (requiring fee award if the court \u201center[s]\njudgment for the plaintiff\u201d).\n          Ultimately, however, plaintiff\u2019s failure to object to\nthe fee statement in the trial court proceeding is dispositive.\nORCP 68 C(4)(f) provides, with respect to attorney fee state-\nments, that \u201c[i]f objections are not timely filed, the court may\naward attorney fees or costs and disbursements sought in\nthe statement.\u201d We have previously recognized the discre-\ntionary nature of \u201cmay\u201d and that the trial court may choose\nto independently assess the fee statement even absent objec-\ntions. Moreau v. Samalin, 295 Or App 534, 538, 435 P3d\n794 (2019) (\u201cEven when a fee petition is unopposed, the trial\ncourt may make its own assessment of the reasonableness of\nthe fees. See ORCP 68 C(4)(f); Council on Court Procedures,\nStaff Comment to ORCP 68, 32 (Dec 15, 1990) (the trial court\nhas \u2018discretion to pass on the reasonableness of the amounts\nclaimed,\u2019 even when there is no objection).\u201d). Plaintiff has\nnot developed any argument as to how, given ORCP 68 C(4)\n(f), it was an abuse of discretion to award fees and costs as\nrequested when no objection was filed, or why the court was\nrequired to make any findings under the circumstances. See\nMcCarthy v. Oregon Freeze Dry, Inc., 327 Or 185, 187 & n 2,\n957 P2d 1200 (1998) (explaining that \u201cthe objections of a\nparty who resists a petition for attorney fees play an import-\nant role in framing any issues that are relevant to the court\u2019s\ndecision to award or deny attorney fees\u201d and that \u201c[n]o party\nwill be heard to complain of the absence of a finding by the\ncourt on an issue that the party did not raise\u201d).\n        We therefore reject all three assignments of error,\nbased on the lack of any objection in the trial court, which\nallowed the court the option of simply awarding the full\namount requested without conducting an independent\nanalysis.\n        Affirmed.\n\f",

In his only counseled assignment of error,\npetitioner argues that the post-conviction court erred in\ndenying relief on his claim that trial counsel provided inad-\nequate and ineffective assistance by failing to advise him\nin late 2018, before he accepted a plea deal, that his con-\nduct did not constitute the crime of delivery of a controlled\nsubstance. In two pro se supplemental assignments of error,\npetitioner argues that the court also erred because trial\ncounsel provided inadequate and ineffective assistance by\nfailing to request a continuance at sentencing and because\nthe trial court made a comment during sentencing that was\nprejudicial to petitioner. We reject the pro se supplemental\nassignments of error without written discussion, for both\nprocedural and substantive reasons. As for the counseled\nassignment of error, we affirm for the reasons described\nbelow.\n         In October 2018, petitioner was arrested during a\ntraffic stop. The police searched petitioner\u2019s vehicle after\nthe arrest and found 30 grams of methamphetamine, 88.5\ngrams of heroin, a scale, a handgun, and two notebooks\nappearing to contain drug records. Petitioner was charged\nwith delivery of heroin, delivery of methamphetamine, felon\nin possession of a firearm, second-degree criminal posses-\nsion of a forged instrument, resisting arrest, identity theft,\nand first-degree theft. Two months later, pursuant to a plea\nagreement, he pleaded guilty to delivery of heroin, felon in\npossession of a firearm, and resisting arrest, and the remain-\ning charges were dismissed. After an unsuccessful direct\nappeal, petitioner sought post-conviction relief. He alleged,\namong other things, that trial counsel had provided inad-\nequate and ineffective assistance by failing to advise him\nthat his conduct did not constitute the crime of delivery of a\ncontrolled substance\u2014a claim that rested on the overruling\nof State v. Boyd, 92 Or App 51, 756 P2d 1276, rev den, 307 Or\n77 (1988), by State v. Hubbell, 314 Or App 844, 500 P3d 728\n(2021), aff\u2019d, 371 Or 340, 537 P3d 503 (2023), nearly three\nyears after petitioner pleaded guilty. The post-conviction\ncourt denied relief, and petitioner now appeals.\n\f84                                            Ayala v. Fhuere\n\n         A criminal defendant has the right to adequate and\neffective assistance of counsel under Article I, section 11, of\nthe Oregon Constitution and the Sixth Amendment to the\nUnited States Constitution. Antoine v. Taylor, 368 Or 760,\n767, 499 P3d 48 (2021). A violation of those rights entitles a\npetitioner to post-conviction relief. ORS 138.530(1)(a). Under\nthe Oregon Constitution, to succeed on a claim of inadequate\nassistance, petitioner must establish by a preponderance of\nthe evidence that \u201ccounsel failed to exercise reasonable pro-\nfessional skill and judgment, and that the petitioner suffered\nprejudice as a result.\u201d Johnson v.

He claims that his attorney should have\nforeseen that eventuality in 2018 and advised him accord-\ningly\u2014that is, advised him that, if he were convicted at trial\nof delivery of heroin or methamphetamine, those convictions\nmight be reversed on appeal if he challenged Boyd and we\nor the Supreme Court decided to overturn it, as ultimately\nhappened in Hubbell in 2021.

Miller v. Lampert, 340 Or 1, 15-16, 125 P3d\n1260 (2006). Indeed, even when a legal issue is \u201cunsettled,\u201d\nan inadequate-assistance claim will prevail \u201conly if \u2018the\nstate of the law was so obviously ambiguous that any law-\nyer exercising reasonable professional skill and judgment\n\fCite as 339 Or App 82 (2025)                                85\n\nnecessarily would have seen it.\u2019 \u201d Curry v.

New Jersey, 530\nUS 466, 120 S Ct 2348, 147 L Ed 2d 435 (2000), that sen-\ntence enhancement facts must be found by a jury. Similarly,\nin Kelly, 318 Or App at 569-70, we held that the petition-\ner\u2019s counsel did not perform deficiently, given existing law,\nwhere counsel did not foresee in 2015 that the United States\nSupreme Court would hold five years later in Ramos v.\nLouisiana, 590 US 83, 140 S Ct 1390, 206 L Ed 2d 583 (2020),\nthat nonunanimous guilty verdicts are unconstitutional.\n         Returning to the present case, Boyd was decided\nin 1988. It expressly held that a person could be convicted\nof the completed crime of delivery of a controlled substance\nbased on evidence that they possessed a large amount of a\ncontrolled substance with the intent to sell it. Boyd, 92 Or\nApp at 54-55 (so holding, based on our construction of ORS\n475.005(8), which defined \u201cdelivery\u201d to include \u201cattempted\ntransfer\u201d). That was the law for more than 30 years, until\n2021, when we overturned Boyd in Hubbell. Hubbell held that\npossession of a large amount of a controlled substance with\nthe intent to sell it could support a conviction for attempted\ndelivery, but that completed delivery required more. See\n\f86                                                         Ayala v.

In petitioner\u2019s view,\nhad counsel so advised him, he could and would have pro-\nceeded to trial, been convicted of the delivery counts, and\ngotten Boyd overturned on appeal in his own case, result-\ning in the reversal of those convictions (presumably to be\nreplaced with attempted delivery convictions).\n         We are unpersuaded that petitioner\u2019s counsel\u2019s\nreliance on Boyd while advising him in late 2018 reflects a\nfailure to exercise reasonable skill and judgment. Boyd had\nbeen controlling precedent for 30 years at that point, and its\ndemise was sudden. Indeed, even the defendant in Hubbell\ndid not foresee the change in the law\u2014we decided sua sponte\nto re-examine \u201cthe settled rule\u201d of Boyd in Hubbell and\nrequested supplemental briefing toward that end. Hubbell,\n314 Or App at 847; id. at 854 (explaining how we came to\ndecide to revisit Boyd). Controlling for the distorting effect\nof hindsight, we agree with the post-conviction court that\npetitioner\u2019s trial counsel did not fail to exercise reasonable\nprofessional skill and judgment by advising petitioner in a\nmanner consistent with then-existing law and without ref-\nerence to the possibility that Boyd could be overruled in the\nfuture. Accordingly, the post-conviction could did not err in\ndenying relief on the claim at issue.\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n    1\n      The legislature amended the delivery statutes in 2024 to effectively rein-\nstate the Boyd rule.

J.\n         Petitioner appeals the denial of his petition for post-\nconviction relief. In his only counseled assignment of error,\npetitioner argues that the post-conviction court erred in\ndenying relief on his claim that trial counsel provided inad-\nequate and ineffective assistance by failing to advise him\nin late 2018, before he accepted a plea deal, that his con-\nduct did not constitute the crime of delivery of a controlled\nsubstance. In two pro se supplemental assignments of error,\npetitioner argues that the court also erred because trial\ncounsel provided inadequate and ineffective assistance by\nfailing to request a continuance at sentencing and because\nthe trial court made a comment during sentencing that was\nprejudicial to petitioner. We reject the pro se supplemental\nassignments of error without written discussion, for both\nprocedural and substantive reasons. As for the counseled\nassignment of error, we affirm for the reasons described\nbelow.\n         In October 2018, petitioner was arrested during a\ntraffic stop. The police searched petitioner\u2019s vehicle after\nthe arrest and found 30 grams of methamphetamine, 88.5\ngrams of heroin, a scale, a handgun, and two notebooks\nappearing to contain drug records. Petitioner was charged\nwith delivery of heroin, delivery of methamphetamine, felon\nin possession of a firearm, second-degree criminal posses-\nsion of a forged instrument, resisting arrest, identity theft,\nand first-degree theft. Two months later, pursuant to a plea\nagreement, he pleaded guilty to delivery of heroin, felon in\npossession of a firearm, and resisting arrest, and the remain-\ning charges were dismissed. After an unsuccessful direct\nappeal, petitioner sought post-conviction relief. He alleged,\namong other things, that trial counsel had provided inad-\nequate and ineffective assistance by failing to advise him\nthat his conduct did not constitute the crime of delivery of a\ncontrolled substance\u2014a claim that rested on the overruling\nof State v.

State of Oregon\n\n         JACQUOT, J.\n          On appeal from a judgment denying post-conviction\nrelief, petitioner argues that the post-conviction court erred\nwhen it denied relief on his claims of ineffective assistance\nof trial and appellate counsel. Petitioner argues that trial\ncounsel was ineffective in failing to obtain additional police\nrecords regarding similar allegations made by the underage\nvictim against other people, and in failing to request a hear-\ning regarding the use of restraints on petitioner during his\nbench trial. Petitioner also argues that appellate counsel was\nineffective in not assigning error to the use of restraints or\nto the trial court compelling him to appear in prison clothing\nduring trial. We affirm.\n          We review the post-conviction court\u2019s denial of relief\nfor legal error. Green v. Franke, 357 Or 301, 312, 350 P3d 188\n(2015). We are bound by the post-conviction court\u2019s findings\nof historical fact if those findings are supported by the evi-\ndence in the record. Id. To succeed on a claim of inadequate\nassistance of counsel, a petitioner must show (1) that trial\ncounsel failed to exercise reasonable professional skill and\njudgment, and (2) that the petitioner suffered prejudice as\na result. Id. A petitioner may establish prejudice by demon-\nstrating that counsel\u2019s failure \u201ccould have tended to affect\u201d\nthe outcome of the proceedings, meaning more than \u201cmere\npossibility, but less than probability.\u201d Id. at 322-23.\n          In his first assignment of error, petitioner argues that\nthe post-conviction court erred when it denied his claim that\nhis trial counsel was inadequate in not obtaining additional\npolice records about prior similar allegations made by the\nvictim against others. The court denied relief, because coun-\nsel had presented evidence at trial that the victim had made\nprior allegations against others and \u201cvigorously argued these\npoints,\u201d including through an expert witness, and petitioner\ncould not show prejudice, because the records that petitioner\nalleged his trial counsel should have obtained did not contain\nany additional admissible information that was not presented\nat his trial.\n       Petitioner has not put forth any viable legal theory\nunder which the additional unobtained records could have\n\fNonprecedential Memo Op: 339 Or App 185 (2025)              187\n\nbeen admitted or used by trial counsel, nor has he shown\nthat the records contained anything that trial counsel had\nnot argued based upon the evidence that counsel did obtain.\nTherefore, petitioner has not shown that trial counsel\u2019s\nfailure to obtain the additional records could have tended\nto affect the outcome of the proceedings or that the post-\nconviction court erred in determining that trial counsel was\nnot ineffective in not obtaining additional police records.\n          In his second assignment of error, petitioner argues\nthat the post-conviction court erred when it denied his claim\nthat his trial counsel was inadequate in not objecting to the\ntrial court failing to make required findings on the record to\njustify the use of restraints. Upon trial counsel\u2019s request that\npetitioner not be restrained for trial, the trial court deferred\nto the jail\u2019s policy of keeping defendants in restraints during\nbench trials, and it assured petitioner and counsel that the\nrestraints would not impact its determinations in the case.\nThe deputy extended the restraint on petitioner\u2019s right hand\nso that he could write notes to his attorney during the pro-\nceedings. The court also would not allow petitioner to change\ninto civilian clothes.\n         A criminal defendant has the right to be free from\nphysical restraint during their trial, unless the court finds,\non the record, that there is evidence that the defendant poses\n\u201can immediate or serious risk of committing dangerous or\ndisruptive behavior, or * * * a serious risk of escape.\u201d State v.\nMcCright, 282 Or App 692, 700, 386 P3d 141 (2016). To show\nthat counsel was ineffective, a post-conviction petitioner\nmust prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that \u201ctrial\ncounsel\u2019s failure to object to the use of [restraints] without\nan adequate showing that petitioner posed a security risk\nhad a tendency to affect the result of his trial.\u201d Sproule v.\nCoursey, 276 Or App 417, 426, 367 P3d 946, rev den, 359 Or\n777 (2016) (internal quotation marks omitted). There are\nthree foundational types of prejudice that may result from\nerroneous restraint of a defendant during trial: \u201c(1) impinge-\nment on the presumption of innocence and the dignity of\njudicial proceedings; (2) inhibition of the accused\u2019s decision\nwhether to take the stand as a witness; and (3) inhibition of\nthe accused\u2019s consultation with his or her attorney.\u201d State v.\n\f188                           Chavez-Meza v. State of Oregon\n\nWall, 252 Or App 435, 442, 287 P3d 1250 (2012), rev den, 353\nOr 280 (2013). In addressing any potential prejudice from the\nuse of restraints, the question is whether there is a \u201cmaterial\nimpairment\u201d of those three interests. McCright, 282 Or App\nat 700. The concern for prejudice is less so in bench trials\nthan in jury trials, but it is nonetheless present. Id. at 701.\n         Here, the trial court erred because it did not make\nany findings regarding defendant\u2019s behavioral or escape risk,\ninstead relying solely on the jail\u2019s restraint policy. See id. at\n699-700 (trial court must make an independent determina-\ntion about the defendant\u2019s risk and cannot rely solely upon\nthe conclusions of others). However, that is not the issue in\nthis proceeding. The question before the post-conviction court\nwas whether trial counsel was ineffective in failing to request\na hearing or object to the trial court\u2019s failure to make the\nrequired findings, and whether petitioner suffered prejudice\nas a result. The post-conviction court denied relief for several\nreasons: Trial counsel did object to the use of restraints and\nwas repeatedly denied by the trial court; an accommodation\nwas made so that petitioner could take notes during the trial;\npetitioner was \u201cunable to show the use of restraints caused\nhim to appear guilty before the jury,\u201d because it was a bench\ntrial; the trial court repeatedly assured that the restraints\nwould not impact its determination; and petitioner did not\nshow that the restraints affected his ability to communicate\nwith his attorney or participate in the trial.\n        Petitioner has not provided any argument as to\nhow the post-conviction court\u2019s determination reflects legal\nerror. The court considered each of the types of prejudice\nand determined that petitioner did not meet his burden to\nshow that the erroneous restraint had a tendency to affect\nthe verdict, and its factual determinations are supported by\nevidence in the record. See State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Millican,\n138 Or App 142, 147-48, 906 P2d 857 (1995), rev den, 323\nOr 114 (1996) (finding harmless juvenile\u2019s shackling where\nthe juvenile court stated that the restraints \u201cwon\u2019t affect\nthe Court\u2019s view of the evidence here,\u201d and that, based upon\nthis court\u2019s independent review of the evidence, we did not\n\u201cbelieve that the trial court\u2019s credibility determinations\nwere impermissibly skewed\u201d).\n\fNonprecedential Memo Op: 339 Or App 185 (2025)            189\n\n         Regarding petitioner\u2019s argument that trial counsel\nwas ineffective in not preserving the issue of his errone-\nous restraint for appeal, as explained below, petitioner has\nnot shown that he would have succeeded on appeal even if\nthe argument had been preserved. Accordingly, the post-\nconviction court did not err in determining that trial coun-\nsel was not ineffective in failing to further object to the use\nof restraints.\n         Finally, in his third and fourth assignments of error,\npetitioner argues that appellate counsel was ineffective in\nfailing to assign error to the trial court\u2019s lack of findings\nto justify the restraints and to its decision that petitioner\ncould not wear his civilian clothes. To prevail on a claim of\nineffective assistance of appellate counsel, petitioner must\nestablish \u201c(1) that a competent appellate counsel would have\nasserted the claim, and (2) that had the claim of error been\nraised, it is more probable than not that the result would\nhave been different.\u201d Guinn v. Cupp, 304 Or 488, 496, 747\nP2d 984 (1987).\n          We have previously determined that, in a bench\ntrial, an error by the trial court in not making the required\nindividualized findings about a defendant\u2019s risk to justify\nrestraint is harmless, particularly when the trial court\nacknowledges that it will not allow the restraints to impact\nits decision. See, e.g., McCright, 282 Or App at 700; Millican,\n138 Or App at 147-48. Petitioner points to our comment in\nMcCright that when a trial is \u201cessentially, a credibility con-\ntest,\u201d erroneous restraint might not be harmless, as opposed\nto when there are no material factual disputes making \u201cthe\npotential for impermissible subconscious skewing\u201d of the\ntrial court\u2019s factual determinations \u201cnonexistent.\u201d 282 Or\nApp at 701 (internal quotation marks omitted). However, in\nthis posture, under the standard to prevail on a claim of\nineffective assistance of appellate counsel, petitioner must\nshow that it is \u201cmore probable than not\u201d that the claim\nwould have prevailed. Guinn, 304 Or at 496. Although a\ntrial with no factual disputes presents a \u201cnonexistent\u201d risk\nof impermissible subconscious skewing, that does not mean\nthat it is necessarily \u201cmore probable than not\u201d that any risk\ngreater than nonexistent would result in reversal on appeal.\n\f190                                 Chavez-Meza v. State of Oregon\n\nWe cannot say that the trial was solely a \u201ccredibility con-\ntest\u201d in the way that petitioner portrays, seeing as there was\nproof of communication between petitioner and the 12-year-\nold victim, and petitioner admitted to having sexual contact\nwith the victim.1 And, petitioner does not point to anything\nin the record to indicate that the trial court\u2019s credibility\ndeterminations were impermissibly skewed.\n          We do not imply here that, in a bench trial, the\npotential for unconscious bias against a restrained defen-\ndant does not exist, or that erroneous restraint will always\nbe harmless; nor do we downplay the affect that being held\nin restraints has on the presumption of innocence. See\nUnited States v. Sanchez-Gomez, 859 F3d 649, 661 (9th Cir\n2017), vac\u2019d on other grounds, 584 US 381, 138 S Ct 1532,\n200 L Ed 2d 792 (2018) (right against shackling absent indi-\nvidualized assessment of essential state interest applies in\nall proceedings, including bench trials, and \u201crespects our\nfoundational principle that defendants are innocent until\nproven guilty\u201d; courts \u201ccannot delegate this constitutional\nquestion to those who provide security\u201d); People v. Hamlett,\n193 NYS3d 658, 663, 80 Misc 3d 303, 307 (NY Crim Ct 2023)\n(\u201cIt cannot merely be assumed that judges are immune from\nthe prejudice and bias caused by visible shackles. We judges\nare human, and the sight of a defendant in restraints may\nunconsciously influence even a judicial factfinder.\u201d (Internal\nquotation marks omitted.)); People v. Williams, 2016 IL App\n(3d) 130901, \u00b6 30, 53 NE3d 1019, 1027 (2016) (\u201cAlthough the\npossibility of prejudicing the jury is a factor to be considered,\nthe reasons for forbidding shackling are not limited to trials\nby jury.\u201d). But in the posture and given the circumstances of\nthis case, we cannot say that it is more likely than not that\npetitioner would have prevailed on appeal.\n         Petitioner\u2019s argument that appellate counsel was\nineffective in failing to assign error to the trial court\u2019s denial\nof his request to appear in civilian clothing is also unavail-\ning. Petitioner provides no legal authority to show that,\neven had appellate counsel raised the issue on appeal, it\nwould have resulted in a reversal of petitioner\u2019s convictions.\n    1\n      Although petitioner later disputed the veracity of that confession, that\nissue was litigated through appeal unsuccessfully. State v. Chavez-Meza, 301 Or\nApp 373, 374 n 1, 456 P3d 322 (2019), rev den, 366 Or 493 (2020).\n\fNonprecedential Memo Op: 339 Or App 185 (2025)        191\n\nAccordingly, the post-conviction court did not err when it\ndetermined that appellate counsel was not ineffective.\n        Affirmed.\n\f",

Petitioner asserts that he is the biolog-\nical father of A and assigns error to the trial court\u2019s failure\nto determine paternity and to dismiss the guardianship. We\naffirm.\n         As the result of involvement with the Department\nof Human Services (DHS), and with A\u2019s mother\u2019s consent, A\u2019s\nmaternal grandmother became A\u2019s guardian in 2017. At that\ntime, petitioner was incarcerated. In 2022, A\u2019s mother moved\nto terminate the guardianship, a request she later withdrew.\nAfter A\u2019s mother made that motion, petitioner sought to inter-\nvene in the case, asserting that he was A\u2019s biological father. In\nsupport, petitioner alleged that he \u201ccontemporaneously filed\na Petition to Establish Custody, Parenting Time, and Child\nSupport in Jackson County Case No. 22DR20597, and expects\nto have paternity officially be established through that case.\u201d\nThe trial court granted petitioner\u2019s motion to intervene. At\npetitioner\u2019s request, the trial court ordered DNA testing for\nthe purpose of establishing paternity. Petitioner completed\nthe DNA test and filed the results with the court.\n        Petitioner next moved to dismiss the guardian-\nship proceeding, arguing that the result of the DNA testing\ndemonstrated that he was A\u2019s father:\n   \u201cPaternity has been established, and Intervenor is now\n   ready to assume custody of the child and provide for the\n   child\u2019s physical, mental, and emotional needs. It would be\n   in the best interests of the child for her to live with him,\n   and moreover Intervenor\u2019s rights as a parent necessarily\n   trump the interests of the Guardian/Grandparent.\u201d\nThe guardian opposed that request and asserted that pater-\nnity was not \u201cestablished\u201d because A\u2019s mother had been dat-\ning both petitioner and his \u201cbiologically similar\u201d brother at\nthe time A was conceived. Petitioner did not file a motion to\nestablish paternity, nor did he provide the court with the\nresults of the Jackson County case that he averred, in his\ninitial motion to intervene, would establish paternity.\n\f108                                                  Davis v. Deen\n\n       At the hearing on petitioner\u2019s motion to dismiss the\nguardianship, the trial court made several observations:\n       \u201cSo what I have in front of me now is a two-page\u2014it\u2019s a\n   one-and-a-half page motion to dismiss guardianship and a\n   one-page declaration with seven paragraphs, and there is\n   nothing\u2014there\u2019s a reference, the declaration by Mr. Davis\n   in paragraph 4, \u2018My paternity of [A] has been confirmed by\n   a court-ordered DNA test, the results of which are on file\n   with the court,\u2019 but that\u2014that is an evidentiary matter.\n      \u201c* * * * *\n       \u201cThe way Oregon evidence law requires hearings to be\n   conducted is there [are] exhibits and there is testimony, and\n   if there\u2019s an exhibit that is offered into evidence, the exhibit\n   needs to physically be offered, handed to the court clerk,\n   and it needs to be then determined whether or not it meets\n   the requirements of the law of evidence. If it does, the judge\n   is to rule that it\u2019s admitted into evidence. And there\u2019s also\n   testimony, and witnesses are sworn under oath, and they\n   testify, and that\u2019s what happens in judicial determinations.\n      \u201cAnd your motion is to dismiss a guardianship. It\u2019s not\n   a motion to adjudicate paternity that I see, so I\u2014I\u2019m not\n   quite sure procedurally what foundation exists.\u201d\nPetitioner\u2019s counsel responded that the court should take\njudicial notice of the result of the DNA testing that, according\nto petitioner, was already in the court record without other\nparties\u2019 objection. Petitioner further pointed to a statutory\nevidentiary presumption providing that a blood test that\nresults in a \u201ccumulative paternity index of 99 or greater\u201d cre-\nates a \u201cdisputable presumption of paternity.\u201d ORS 109.258. In\nresponse, guardian\u2019s counsel disputed petitioner\u2019s assertion\nthere was no objection to the blood test establishing paternity:\n   \u201cWe object to the paternity, and we don\u2019t think that a DNA\n   test alone in this circumstance is good enough, and we\u2019d be\n   happy to put evidence on if this was a hearing on paternity,\n   which it isn\u2019t.\u201d\nAfter hearing additional argument, the court ruled:\n       \u201cJudges are limited to making decisions based on what\n   is in front of the judge in a given case, in a given court\n   proceeding. What is in front of this court at this time is the\n   motion of [petitioner] to dismiss guardianship. * * *\n\fCite as 339 Or App 106 (2025)                                                109\n\n        \u201cThis court finds that a foundational requirement for\n    the court even to consider this matter is the establishment\n    of paternity. This court finds that paternity has not been\n    formally established. This court finds that a motion to\n    dismiss guardianship is not a proper procedural forum in\n    Coos County to pursue a determination of whether or not\n    there is paternity for [petitioner].\n        \u201cThat\u2019s particularly true because another proceeding is\n    now occurring in another circuit court in another county\n    in Oregon, specifically Jackson County, and under well-\n    established legal principles, where one proceeding is going\n    forward, a judge in another county can\u2019t simply jump in\n    and make determinations particularly where the motion to\n    determine paternity is not implicitly involved in a motion\n    to dismiss a guardianship.\u201d\nThe court denied the motion to dismiss, as well as petition-\ner\u2019s subsequent motion to reconsider. This appeal followed.\n         On appeal, petitioner argues that the trial court\nerred by not determining that petitioner established paternity\nof A and also erred in denying petitioner\u2019s motion to dismiss\nthe guardianship. In his first assignment of error, petitioner\nrenews the arguments he made below; that, pursuant to ORS\n109.258, the DNA test itself established paternity. Deferring\nto the trial court\u2019s factual findings that are supported by evi-\ndence in the record, we review the trial court\u2019s legal conclu-\nsions for legal error. Caswell v. Day Law and Associates, P. C.,\n309 Or App 367, 375, 481 P3d 972 (2021); Brown v. MacDonald\nand Associates, LLC, 260 Or App 275, 277, 317 P3d 301 (2013).1\n         The trial court did not err. As the trial court rec-\nognized, petitioner moved to terminate the guardianship,\nnot to establish paternity. Petitioner did not file a motion\nto establish, nor request an evidentiary hearing regarding,\npaternity. See, e.g., State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. L. V., 219 Or\nApp 207, 211, 182 P3d 866 (2008) (explaining that, after\nfather completed court-ordered genetic testing, \u201cDHS moved\nto establish [father\u2019s] legal paternity under ORS 419B.395\nand ORS 109.258\u201d). Rather, petitioner insisted that no such\nefforts were necessary despite the guardian\u2019s objections\n    1\n      Petitioner requests that we review the trial court\u2019s factual findings de novo\npursuant to ORS 19.415, however, the basis upon which we affirm the trial court\ndoes not involve any factual determinations.\n\f110                                                             Davis v. Deen\n\nto paternity. And, despite the court explaining the proper\npath for petitioner to proceed to present evidence regard-\ning paternity, petitioner insisted that no further steps were\nrequired.\n        As we understand petitioner\u2019s argument, he con-\ntends that ORS 109.2582 required that the trial court deter-\nmine, as a matter of law, that petitioner is A\u2019s father. ORS\n109.258, however, contains no such mandate.\n           ORS 109.258 \u201cprovides that, in a paternity adjudica-\ntion, \u2018[a] disputable presumption of paternity is created if one\nor more blood tests [including DNA tests] result in a cumu-\nlative paternity index of 99 or greater.\u2019 \u201d Sause and Schnitzer,\n371 Or 573, 594, 539 P3d 722 (2023) (emphasis added) (quot-\ning ORS 109.258). The statute is intended \u201cto help resolve evi-\ndentiary disputes over the efficacy of blood tests in identify-\ning putative fathers.\u201d Id. at 597. Accordingly, it does not itself\ncreate a proceeding to establish paternity; rather, it dictates\nhow a trial court must view blood tests in such a proceeding.\nSee id. at 598 (\u201cFor a blood test to lead to legal parentage, as\nORS 109.258 contemplates, there must be an adjudication or\nother proceeding.\u201d); see also ORS 109.124 to 109.230 (estab-\nlishing procedures for filiation proceedings, including who\nmay initiate, where proceedings must occur, and contents of\nhearing). To aid a trial court in making a paternity determi-\nnation in those proceedings, ORS 109.258 creates an eviden-\ntiary presumption \u201cthat may or may not lead to a determina-\ntion of legal parentage.\u201d Sause, 371 Or at 597.\n         Petitioner may be correct that, in certain proceed-\nings,3 he would be entitled to an evidentiary presumption of\n    2\n      ORS 109.258 provides:\n        \u201cA disputable presumption of paternity is created if one or more blood\n    tests result in a cumulative paternity index of 99 or greater. If the court\n    or administrator finds that the conclusions of all the experts, as disclosed\n    by the evidence based upon the tests, are that the alleged father is not the\n    father of the child, the question of paternity shall be resolved accordingly. If\n    the experts disagree in their findings or conclusions, the question shall be\n    submitted upon all the evidence.\u201d\n    3\n      We observe that the proceedings contemplated by the chapter containing\nthat evidentiary presumption do not include guardianship proceedings under\nORS chapter 125. ORS 109.252 (\u201cUnless the court or administrator finds good\ncause not to proceed in a proceeding under ORS 25.501 to 25.556, 109.124 to\n109.230 or 419B.609, in which parentage is a relevant fact, the court * * * upon\n\fCite as 339 Or App 106 (2025)                                                111\n\npaternity based on his blood test. A motion to terminate a\nguardianship, however, is not a proceeding to establish par-\nentage. In the absence of such a proceeding, an evidentiary\npresumption does not automatically establish paternity as a\nmatter of law.4\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\nmotion of any party to the action made at a time so as not to delay the proceedings\nunduly shall, order the mother, child, alleged father and any other named respon-\ndent who may be the father to submit to blood tests.\u201d).\n     4\n       Because we conclude that the trial court\u2019s determination that petitioner\nfailed to take the proper procedural steps to establish paternity was sufficient\nto support its decision, we do not address petitioner\u2019s second assignment of error,\nwhich challenges an alternate basis to support the same ruling. See Allianz\nGlobal Risks v. ACE Property & Casualty Ins. Co., 297 Or App 434, 439, 442 P3d\n212 (2019), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 367 Or 711 (2021) (recognizing that an affir-\nmance of a trial court\u2019s ruling on one basis obviates the need to reach arguments\nchallenging alternate bases supporting trial court\u2019s decision). Our disposition\nalso obviates the need to address petitioner\u2019s third assignment of error, which\nrelies on the premise that paternity was established to challenge the denial of the\nmotion to dismiss the guardianship.\n\f",

B. C. B.\n\n        JOYCE, J.\n         In this juvenile dependency case, father appeals\nfrom a judgment of the juvenile court that took jurisdiction\nover his three children. As we explain below, as to the alle-\ngation that jurisdiction was justified because father\u2019s mental\nhealth problems interfere with his ability to safely parent\nthe children, we agree that the evidence was insufficient to\nsupport that basis on which the juvenile court took jurisdic-\ntion. As to the other bases on which the juvenile court took\njurisdiction, having reviewed the record, we conclude that\nthe court did not err. Accordingly, we reverse and remand\nfor entry of a judgment omitting allegation 2(E) as a basis\nfor jurisdiction and otherwise affirm.\n         We review the sufficiency of the evidence support-\ning dependency jurisdiction by \u201cview[ing] the evidence, as\nsupplemented and buttressed by permissible derivative\ninferences, in the light most favorable to the trial court\u2019s\ndisposition and assess[ing] whether, when so viewed, the\nrecord was legally sufficient to permit that outcome.\u201d Dept.\nof Human Services v. N. P., 257 Or App 633, 639, 307 P3d 444\n(2013). \u201cTo establish a basis for juvenile court jurisdiction\nfor purposes of ORS 419B.100(1)(c), the state must prove, by\na preponderance of the evidence, ORS 419B.310(3), that a\nchild\u2019s welfare is endangered because, under the totality of\nthe circumstances, there is a current threat of serious loss\nor injury to the child that is reasonably likely to be real-\nized.\u201d Dept. of Human Services v. K. C. F., 282 Or App 12, 19,\n383 P3d 931 (2016) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n        The juvenile court took jurisdiction over the three\nchildren on several jurisdictional bases:\n  \u2022   Father has exposed the children to domestic violence\n      against mother;\n  \u2022   Father has physically abused the children and caused\n      them emotional distress;\n  \u2022   Father \u201chas mental health issues which impair his\n      judgment and ability to safely parent the children\u201d; and\n  \u2022   Two of the three children are fearful of returning to\n      father\u2019s care.\n\fNonprecedential Memo Op: 339 Or App 176 (2025)              179\n\n         On the record before us, we readily conclude that\nthe juvenile court correctly took jurisdiction on the first two\nbases, involving domestic violence and physical abuse. As\nto the allegation that two of the three children are afraid of\nreturning to father\u2019s care, father argues that there is no evi-\ndence that the two children\u2019s fear of father exposed the third\nchild\u2014who did not share that same fear\u2014to a risk of harm,\nsuch to support taking jurisdiction over the third child on\nthat basis. Whatever merit that argument may have, father\ndid not make that argument to the juvenile court; his argu-\nment is thus unpreserved, and we decline to address it. See\nDept. of Human Services v. C. M., 284 Or App 521, 530-31,\n392 P3d 820 (2017) (rejecting as unpreserved an argument\nthat the evidence was insufficient to support a jurisdictional\nallegation where the parent failed to challenge that basis\nbelow).\n         We reach a different conclusion with respect to\nthe allegation that father\u2019s mental health interferes with\nhis ability to parent. The evidence related to that allega-\ntion came from the testimony of two of the children, who\ndescribed that father \u201cwent a little crazy\u201d at one point,\nsomeone had put a \u201cspell\u201d or \u201chex\u201d on father, and he was\n\u201cseeing things.\u201d It is not apparent from the record that that\nevidence reflects \u201cmental health issues\u201d; to the extent that\nthe court relied on that evidence, without more information\nabout father\u2019s condition, it is insufficient in any event to sup-\nport a conclusion that there is a reasonable risk of harm to\nthe children as a result. See K. C. F., 282 Or App at 19-20\n(the record lacks evidence of the \u201cserious loss or injury to the\nchild that is reasonably likely to be realized\u201d with respect\nto the allegation (internal quotation marks omitted)). We\ntherefore reverse and remand the jurisdictional judgment\nfor the court to enter a judgment omitting allegation 2(E) as\na basis for jurisdiction.\n         Reversed and remanded for entry of judgment omit-\nting allegation 2(E) as a basis for jurisdiction; otherwise\naffirmed.\n\f",

Plaintiff\nconcedes that we need to address the evidentiary issue only if\nwe agree with plaintiff on the instruction issue.

Plaintiff alleged that she was\ninjured when she slipped on the sign, causing her right foot\nto slip from underneath her, and her left knee, hand, and\nshoulder to hit the ground. Plaintiff alleged that defendant\nwas negligent in securing the sign, in failing to discover that\nthe sign was on the ground, in failing to barricade the area,\nand in failing to monitor the public entryway of the store.\nPlaintiff sought damages for medical bills of $395,169.02 for\nthree back surgeries and other medical treatments, and for\nfuture projected medical bills of $60,000, and sought non-\neconomic damages of $1,000,000.\n         The sign belonged to defendant\u2019s Starbucks conces-\nsion, which was inside defendant\u2019s store. The Starbucks is\nrun by defendant\u2019s employees. It is undisputed that defen-\ndant\u2019s employees did not place the sign on the ground and\ndid not know that it had fallen out of its frame. Plaintiff did\nnot assert that defendant had constructive knowledge that\nthe sign was on the ground.\n         Plaintiff conceded below that res ipsa loquitur does\nnot apply to typical slip-and-fall claims, which typically\ninvolve substances on a floor that might have been handled\n\f114                                     Fisk v. Fred Meyer Stores, Inc.\n\nby customers. But plaintiff distinguished this claim from\nthose, arguing that plaintiff\u2019s claim was more in the nature\nof a \u201cstandard\u201d \u201cconditions\u201d claim, because the sign was not\na substance or thing normally handled by a customer and\nwas within defendant\u2019s exclusive control. Plaintiff requested\na uniform jury instruction on res ipsa loquitur, contending\nthat the evidence was sufficient to give the jury a rational\nbasis to find that it was more probable than not that defen-\ndant\u2019s failure to exercise reasonable care was the cause of\nthe accident.1 The requested res ipsa loquitur instruction\nstated:\n    \u201cThe law assumes that all persons have obeyed the law and\n    have been free from negligence.\n    \u201cHowever, you may find that the defendant was negligent if\n    you find that the incident that caused damage to the plain-\n    tiff is one that, in the normal course of events, would not\n    have occurred unless the defendant was negligent.\u201d\n\n    1\n      We recently discussed res ipsa loquitur in Jackson v. KA-3 Associates, LLC,\n331 Or App 574, 546 P3d 950, rev allowed, 373 Or 81, 546 P3d 950 (2024):\n         \u201cIn the absence of evidence of negligence or the exact cause of an acci-\n    dent, a factfinder can infer negligence and causation under res ipsa loquitur,\n    a rule of circumstantial evidence, if the \u2018accident is of a kind which ordinarily\n    would not have occurred in the absence of the defendant\u2019s negligence, even\n    though it is impossible to determine the specific way in which the defendant\n    was negligent.\u2019 [Hagler v. Coastal Farm Holdings, Inc., 354 Or 132, 146, 309\n    P3d 1073 (2013)]. The plaintiff bears the burden of submitting evidence that\n    the plaintiff\u2019s injury is of the sort that, more likely than not, was caused by\n    negligence on the part of the defendant and therefore is entitled to an infer-\n    ence of negligence under res ipsa loquitur. Id. Whether a reasonable juror\n    could draw such an inference is an issue of law to be determined by the court.\n    Fieux v. Cardiovascular & Thoracic Clinic, P.C., 159 Or App 637, 640, 978 P2d\n    429, rev den, 329 Or 318 (1999).\n         \u201cIn Ritchie v. Thomas et al., 190 Or 95, 114, 224 P2d 543 (1950), the\n    court explained that res ipsa loquitur is a rule of evidence that allows an\n    inference of negligence, rather than a presumption, under certain limited\n    circumstances:\n         \u201c \u2018[T]he fact of injury alone does not raise an inference of negligence. An\n    inference of negligence may arise only when injury is caused by an instru-\n    mentality which is under the control and management of the defendant, and\n    when the accident is such as, in the ordinary course of events does not hap-\n    pen, if those who have the management use ordinary care.\u2019 \u201d\n331 Or App at 582. See also Kaufman v. Fisher, 230 Or 626, 636-40, 371 P2d 948\n(1962) (describing the question under res ipsa loquitur thusly: \u201cCould it have been\nreasonably found by the jury that the accident which occurred in this case is of\na kind which more probable than not would not have occurred in the absence of\nnegligence upon the part of [the defendant]?\u201d).\n\fCite as 339 Or App 112 (2025)                                    115\n\n        The court declined to give the res ipsa loquitur\ninstruction, explaining,\n   \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a situation for res ipsa because that would\n   require * * * that the sign and the A-frame be in the exclu-\n   sive control or almost exclusive control of the Defendant.\n   And being in a public area like that, * * * I don\u2019t think\n   there\u2019s a basis for that.\u201d\nInstead, the court gave general instructions relating to\npremises liability as well as an instruction on slip-and-fall:\n   \u201cA possessor of premises has a duty to make the premise\n   reasonably safe for an invitee\u2019s visit. The possessor must\n   exercise reasonable care to discover any condition that cre-\n   ates an unreasonable risk of harm to the invitee and either\n   eliminate the condition or warn any foreseeable invitee of\n   the risk so the invitee can avoid the harm. If the condition\n   cannot be encountered with reasonable safety, even if the\n   danger was known and appreciated by the invitee, the pos-\n   sessor is obligated to do more than warn. The possessor\n   must take reasonable and feasible steps to eliminate the\n   danger.\n   \u201cOregon law does not automatically impose liability against\n   a business for every slip and fall accident that occurs on the\n   premises. The role of the possessor is not that of an insurer\n   against accidents upon the premises, even as to persons who\n   they have invited to appear. Excuse me. Invited to enter.\n   The mere fact that an invitee was injured on the premises\n   does not, by itself, give rise to an inference of negligence.\n   \u201cIn premises liability cases like this one, where the Plaintiff\n   claims to have been injured by slipping on a sign on the\n   ground of the Defendant\u2019s store, liability will not attach\n   unless the Defendant had actual or constructive knowledge\n   of the sign on the ground and failed to use reasonable care\n   to remove it.\n   \u201cTo prove the Defendant had knowledge of the sign on the\n   ground the Plaintiff must prove one of three things: (1) the\n   sign was placed on the ground by the Defendant, or (2) the\n   Defendant knew that the sign was there and failed to use\n   reasonable diligence to remove it, or (3) the sign had been\n   on the ground for such a length of time that the Defendant\n   should, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, have discov-\n   ered it and removed it.\u201d\n\f116                            Fisk v. Fred Meyer Stores, Inc.\n\n         The jury returned a verdict for defendant. On\nappeal, plaintiff does not assign error to the instructions\nthat the trial court gave or to the trial court\u2019s characteri-\nzation of the claim as involving a slip and fall but argues\nthat the court erred in failing to give plaintiff\u2019s requested\nres ipsa loquitur instruction. \u201cAs a general rule, parties in\na civil action are entitled to jury instructions on their the-\nory of the case if their requested instructions correctly state\nthe law, are based on the current pleadings in the case, and\nare supported by evidence.\u201d Vandeveere-Pratt v. Portland\nHabilitation Center, 242 Or App 554, 557-58, 259 P3d 9\n(2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). Plaintiff con-\ntends that the evidence at trial supported the giving of the\nres ipsa loquitur instruction and that the trial court erred\nin reasoning that res ipsa loquitur was precluded by the fact\nthat the sign was located in a public area and therefore not\nwithin defendant\u2019s exclusive control.\n          Defendant responds, as argued below, that plain-\ntiff\u2019s claim is a \u201cslip and fall\u201d claim to which the doctrine\nof res ipsa loquitur does not apply. See German v. Kienow\u2019s\nFood Stores, 246 Or 334, 336, 425 P2d 523 (1967) (stating\nthat Oregon has not \u201cyet adopted the rule of res ipsa loqui-\ntur in \u2018slip and fall\u2019 cases, and it is still necessary to supply\nsome proof of fault\u201d). Defendant argues, further, that it was\nnot defendant\u2019s burden to show that the sign was not within\ndefendant\u2019s exclusive control but plaintiff\u2019s burden to show\nthat the sign and its frame were within defendant\u2019s exclusive\ncontrol, and that she has failed to do that. In her reply brief,\nplaintiff argues that res ipsa loquitur does not depend on the\n\u201cmechanism of injury,\u201d i.e., whether the injury occurred as a\nresult of a slip and fall, but on whether the evidence would\nallow a finding that the probability of the defendant\u2019s negli-\ngence is greater than the probability of other causes.\n        As the trial court correctly instructed, the general\nrule of premises liability is that possessors of land must\n\u201cmake their property reasonably safe for their invitees.\u201d\nHughes v. Wilson, 345 Or 491, 497, 199 P3d 305 (2008). That\nduty requires the possessor to exercise due care to discover\nconditions on the premises that create an unreasonable risk\nof harm to invitees or warn them of the risk so as to enable\n\fCite as 339 Or App 112 (2025)                                  117\n\nthem to avoid the harm. Woolston v. Wells, 297 Or 548, 557-\n58, 687 P2d 144 (1984).\n          Our caselaw and that of the Supreme Court make\nclear that slip-and-fall claims involving substances or objects\non the floor or ground are simply a subcategory of premises\nliability to which general premises liability standards apply.\nHagler v. Coastal Farm Holdings, Inc., 354 Or 132, 141, 309\nP3d 1073 (2013); Moorehead v. Tri-Met, 273 Or App 54, 359\nP3d 314 (2015), rev den, 358 Or 550 (2016) (\u201cWe conclude that\nthe distinction plaintiff seeks to draw between \u2018condition\u2019\ncases and \u2018foreign substance\u2019 cases is nonexistent.\u201d). When a\nclaim involves a substance or object on the floor or ground,\nthe liability of a business owner depends on evidence that\nthe owner knew or should have known about the fallen sub-\nstance or object. Hagler, 354 Or at 142. In the context of a\nslip-and-fall claim, proof of that liability is captured by the\nthree-factor test described in the caselaw:\n      \u201c(a) That the substance was placed there by the occu-\n   pant, or\n      \u201c(b) That the occupant knew that the substance was\n   there and failed to use reasonable diligence to remove it, or\n       \u201c(c) That the foreign substance had been there for such\n   a length of time that the occupant should, by the exercise of\n   reasonable diligence, have discovered and removed it.\u201d\nCowden v. Earley et al, 214 Or 384, 387, 327 P2d 1109 (1958).\n         Although reported slip-and-fall cases have most\ngenerally involved foreign substances on a floor that cause\na person to slip, Oregon courts have also applied slip-and-\nfall analysis to cases in which an invitee slips on or trips\nover an object in the aisle of a store. See, e.g., Lee v. Meier &\nFrank Co., 166 Or 600, 114 P2d 136 (1941) (holding that a\ncustomer who had tripped over a pillow in the aisle of a store\nfailed to state a claim against the owner of the store); see\nalso Hinchman v. UC Market, LLC, 270 Or App 561, 567 n 3,\n348 P3d 328 (2015) (observing that \u201cslip and fall\u201d analysis\napplied in a claim involving a negligently placed door mat).\n          We agree with defendant that because plain-\ntiff slipped on an object on the ground, plaintiff\u2019s claim is\ncorrectly characterized as a slip-and-fall claim. The trial\n\f118                                    Fisk v. Fred Meyer Stores, Inc.\n\ncourt\u2019s jury instructions therefore correctly described plain-\ntiff\u2019s burden. And, as the Supreme Court held in Kienow\u2019s\nFood Stores, 246 Or at 336, the trial court correctly held\nthat, because the claim involved a slip and fall, the doctrine\nof res ipsa loquitur did not apply.2\n         But even if plaintiff were correct that res ipsa loqui-\ntur could apply in the context of this slip-and-fall claim,\nwe would conclude that the trial court did not err in reject-\ning the requested res ipsa loquitur instruction here. That\nis because, in determining whether to give the requested\ninstruction, it was the trial court\u2019s role to determine whether\nthere was evidence from which the jury could find that the\naccident was of a kind more likely than not attributable to\ndefendant\u2019s negligence. Hammer v. Fred Meyer Stores, Inc.,\n242 Or App 185, 194, 255 P3d 598 (2011) (\u201c \u2018The determina-\ntion of where the probabilities lie must, ordinarily, be made\nupon the basis of past experience as it is seen and appraised\nby the court.\u201d\u2019 (quoting Kaufman, 230 Or at 639)). As the\ntrial court concluded, a jury could not plausibly have found\nthat it was more probable than not that defendant\u2019s failure\nto exercise reasonable care was the cause of the accident,\nbecause there were a number of causes other than defen-\ndant\u2019s alleged negligence that could have caused the sign to\nbe on the ground and plaintiff to fall. See Hammer, 242 Or\nApp at 190-91 (\u201cRes ipsa loquitur is a rule of circumstantial\nevidence that permits a jury to infer both negligence and\ncausation if the harm that occurs is \u2018\u201dof a kind that which\nmore probably than not would not have occurred in the\nabsence of negligence on the part of the defendant\u201d\u2019 McKee\nElectric Co. v. Carson Oil Co., 301 Or 339, 353, 723 P2d 288\n(1986) (quoting Watzig v. Tobin, 292 Or 645, 649, 642 P2d\n651 (1982)).\u201d). We conclude, therefore, that the trial court did\nnot err in declining to give plaintiff\u2019s requested instruction.\n         Plaintiff concedes that her second assignment of\nerror, in which she contends that the trial court erred in\n\n     2\n       We do not conclude here that res ipsa loquitur could never apply to a claim\nin which a business invitee slips and falls in the defendant\u2019s premises. But appli-\ncation of the presumption of res ipsa loquitur to a claim like plaintiff\u2019s, where,\nas here, a business invitee slips on a substance or object on the business own-\ner\u2019s floor or ground, is inconsistent with the three-factor inquiry that generally\napplies to the determination of liability in those types of cases.\n\fCite as 339 Or App 112 (2025)                             119\n\nadmitting testimony of plaintiff\u2019s treating physician, is con-\ntingent on our acceptance of plaintiff\u2019s first assignment of\nerror, and we therefore do not reach it.\n        Affirmed.\n\f",

Dept. of Human Services\n\nmember of [her] household.\u201d (Boldface and uppercase omit-\nted). During the contested hearing to substantiate that alle-\ngation, the Department of Human Services (DHS) offered\nevidence that Levi provided petitioner\u2019s address for his\nemployment applications, car registration, financial records,\nas well as a note from petitioner\u2019s landlord. In that note,\npetitioner\u2019s landlord listed Levi as an occupant of the apart-\nment, but admitted that he was a \u201chands off\u201d landlord and\nthus was \u201cnot sure\u201d who was living in the apartment. He\nalso stated that he met the family through his ex-girlfriend\nbut, after that relationship ended in October 2018, he had\n\u201clost touch\u201d with petitioner and Levi.\n        Petitioner disputed that Levi resided with her full-\ntime. She testified that Levi lives elsewhere \u201cninety-five\npercent of the time\u201d and that he uses her address only for\nmailing purposes. Levi was not listed on the lease of the\napartment. And in his own application for SNAP benefits,\nLevi wrote that he lives at petitioner\u2019s residence only \u201cpart-\ntime\u201d and that he also lives in his car.\n         The ALJ concluded that petitioner committed an\nIPV because the \u201coverwhelming evidence in the record\ndemonstrate[d] that\u201d petitioner intentionally misrepre-\nsented her household income by not reporting that Levi lived\nwith her.2 On appeal, petitioner contends that neither sub-\nstantial evidence nor reason supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion.\n         We \u201cshall set aside or remand the order if [we] find[ ]\nthat the order is not supported by substantial evidence in\nthe record.

Notwithstanding\nthe fact that petitioner did not bear the burden of proof at the hearing, there was\nevidence in the record that the couple had lived separately due to domestic vio-\nlence, and petitioner testified that DHS told her to not list Levi on the application\nif she was experiencing domestic violence, out of concern for her safety.\n\fNonprecedential Memo Op: 339 Or App 170 (2025)                             173\n\n         We conclude that substantial evidence does not sup-\nport the finding that petitioner intentionally misrepresented\nher household composition. The ALJ relied exclusively on\nthe facts that Levi listed petitioner\u2019s address on various doc-\numents and that petitioner\u2019s landlord was aware that Levi\nwas at petitioner\u2019s apartment at some point during 2018 to\nconclude that there was \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d that peti-\ntioner misrepresented Levi\u2019s housing status. However, Levi\u2019s\nuse of the address is not on its own sufficient to prove by\nclear and convincing evidence that petitioner intentionally\nprovided false information on her applications, particularly\nwhen evidence in the record supports the contention that\nLevi lived in multiple places. The only other evidence sup-\nporting the ALJ\u2019s decision\u2014petitioner\u2019s landlord\u2019s note stat-\ning that Levi lived there\u2014also states that the landlord had\n\u201clost touch\u201d with petitioner and was unaware of who was\nin the apartment during most of the time period relevant\nto the hearing. Moreover, there was significant countervail-\ning evidence, including petitioner\u2019s testimony, the lease, and\nLevi\u2019s benefits applications.3 Accordingly, we conclude that\nthe ALJ\u2019s finding that DHS proved by clear and convinc-\ning evidence that petitioner intentionally misrepresented\nher household composition is not supported by substantial\nevidence. See Smithee v. Employment Dept., 228 Or App\n346, 350, 208 P3d 956 (2009) (concluding that substantial\nevidence did not support the ALJ\u2019s finding that claimant,\nwho undisputedly went over his break time, intentionally\nviolated a timekeeping regulation because there was coun-\ntervailing evidence that his employer allowed him to take\nunreported breaks and lacked a clear policy on work-break\nreporting).\n           Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n    3\n      Petitioner sought an extension of time, her first request, to obtain addi-\ntional evidence given that DHS had a year to prepare its case and her Oregon\nLaw Center attorney had less than three weeks to marshal evidence, and, addi-\ntionally, was scheduled to be out of the office during the hearing.

Shortly\nthereafter, plaintiffs and Hartford executed a \u201cRelease and\nSettlement Agreement,\u201d under which the parties settled\nplaintiffs\u2019 insurance and breach of contract claims \u201cand\nall related controversies.\u201d Plaintiffs then filed a motion for\nsummary judgment in the proceeding, seeking prejudgment\ninterest from Hartford under ORS 82.010,1 on the theory\nthat the amount due on plaintiffs\u2019 insurance claim became\n\n     1\n       ORS 82.010 provides, in part:\n          \u201c(1) The rate of interest for the following transactions, if the parties have\n     not otherwise agreed to a rate of interest, is nine percent per annum and is\n     payable on:\n          \u201c(a) All moneys after they become due; but open accounts bear interest\n     from the date of the last item thereof.\n          \u201c(b) Money received to the use of another and retained beyond a reason-\n     able time without the owner\u2019s express or implied consent.\n          \u201c(c) Money due or to become due where there is a contract to pay interest\n     and no rate specified.\n          \u201c(2) Except as provided in this subsection, the rate of interest on judg-\n     ments for the payment of money is nine percent per annum. The following\n     apply as described:\n          \u201c(a) Interest on a judgment under this subsection accrues from the date\n     of the entry of the judgment unless the judgment specifies another date.\n          \u201c(b) Interest on a judgment under this subsection is simple interest,\n     unless otherwise provided by contract.\n          \u201c(c) Interest accruing from the date of the entry of a judgment shall also\n     accrue on interest that accrued before the date of entry of a judgment.\n          \u201c(d) Interest under this subsection shall also accrue on attorney fees and\n     costs entered as part of the judgment.\n          \u201c(e) A judgment on a contract bearing more than nine percent interest\n     shall bear interest at the same rate provided in the contract as of the date of\n     entry of the judgment.\u201d\n\fCite as 339 Or App 40 (2025)                                 43\n\nascertainable (and therefore \u201cdue\u201d) thirty days after the\nclaim was filed and that prejudgment interest was owed\nas provided in ORS 82.010(1), on \u201c[a]ll moneys after they\nbecome due.\u201d The trial court denied the motion, determin-\ning that it was premature, as there had been no judgment\nentered against Hartford.\n         Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their remaining\nclaims against Hartford. They then filed a petition for attor-\nney fees and costs and also refiled their motion for summary\njudgment seeking prejudgment interest. The trial court\nentered what was captioned a \u201csupplemental judgment,\u201d\ndenying plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on their\nrequest for prejudgment interest. In a limited judgment, the\ntrial court denied plaintiffs\u2019 request for costs but awarded\nplaintiffs their attorney fees of $221,179.27.\n         Plaintiffs appeal from the supplemental judgment,\nassigning error to the denial of their motion for summary\njudgment on their claim of prejudgment interest and appeal\nfrom a limited judgment denying costs. Hartford cross-\nappeals from the trial court\u2019s limited judgment awarding\nplaintiffs attorney fees, asserting that the trial court erro-\nneously awarded fees on a contingent or percentage-of-re-\ncovery basis. On plaintiffs\u2019 appeal of the supplemental judg-\nment denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment, we\nconclude that the supplemental judgment is not an appeal-\nable judgment and therefore dismiss the appeal; on plain-\ntiffs\u2019 appeal of the limited judgment, we conclude that the\ntrial court did not err or abuse its discretion in rejecting\nplaintiffs\u2019 request to recover their costs. On Hartford\u2019s cross-\nappeal of the limited judgment, we conclude that the trial\ncourt abused its discretion in determining that a fee based\non a contingency or a percentage of recovery\u2014rather than\nbased on hours worked\u2014was a reasonable fee, and, there-\nfore, reverse and remand for reconsideration of the limited\njudgment awarding fees.\n        In their first assignment of error, plaintiffs contend\nthat the trial court erred in denying their motion for sum-\nmary judgment on their claim for what they characterize\nas \u201cprejudgment interest.\u201d As noted, plaintiffs filed their\nmotion after they had reached a settlement with Hartford\n\f44   Griffith v. Property and Casualty Ins. Co. of Hartford\n\non their insurance claim and had fully released Hartford on\nthe breach of contract claims, which were the only claims\nthat could support an award of prejudgment interest, had a\njudgment been entered. But there was no general judgment\nand no limited monetary judgment for plaintiffs on either\nthe insurance claim or on plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract or\ntort claims. On the motion, the trial court entered a docu-\nment captioned \u201cSupplemental Judgment\u201d in which it stated\nthat the summary judgment was \u201cdenied.\u201d Plaintiffs con-\ntend that the trial court erred in denying their motion for\nsummary judgment, because the amount of interest owed to\nplaintiffs as of the date that Hartford should have paid pol-\nicy limits (which plaintiffs assert was within 30 days after\nplaintiffs\u2019 loss) was readily ascertainable, and prejudgment\ninterest was therefore awardable under ORS 82.010.\n         Hartford responds that the court\u2019s denial of the\nmotion is either not reviewable or was correct on its mer-\nits, because there is no basis for an award of prejudgment\ninterest in the absence of a judgment. Additionally, even\nassuming reviewability, Hartford asserts that the record as\nto plaintiffs\u2019 entitlement to prejudgment interest includes\ndisputed issues of material fact.\n        For several reasons, the trial court\u2019s ruling is not\nreviewable. First and foremost, the document captioned\n\u201cSupplemental Judgment,\u201d which simply denied plaintiffs\u2019\nmotion for summary judgment, is not an appealable judg-\nment. That is because it is not a proper supplemental judg-\nment, as no general judgment had been entered on plaintiffs\u2019\nbreach of contract claims. ORS 18.005(17) (A supplemental\njudgment is \u201ca judgment that may be rendered after a gen-\neral judgment pursuant to a legal authority.\u201d).\n         Secondly, even if the supplemental judgment were\nappealable, the denial of the motion for summary judg-\nment would not be reviewable. That is because, with limited\nexceptions, the denial of a motion for summary judgment\nis not reviewable on appeal. See Martin v. State of Oregon,\n331 Or App 225, 226 n 1, 545 P3d 776 (2024) (stating rule);\nFarnsworth v. Meadowland Ranches, Inc., 321 Or App 814,\n819, 519 P3d 153 (2022) (noting that \u201ca trial court\u2019s denial\nof summary judgment is generally unreviewable on appeal,\n\fCite as 339 Or App 40 (2025)                                               45\n\nwith limited exceptions,\u201d such as when the motion rests on\n\u201cpurely legal contentions\u201d). For example, in a case that has\ngone to trial, the denial of a summary judgment motion is\nsubject to review on appeal if the motion rested on a \u201cpurely\nlegal\u201d contention. Seidel v. Time Ins. Co., 157 Or App 556,\n560, 970 P2d 255 (1998). And when, for example, the appeal\narises from cross-motions for summary judgment, the grant-\ning of one motion and the denial of the other are both review-\nable. Eden Gate, Inc. v. D&L Excavating & Trucking, Inc.,\n178 Or App 610, 622, 37 P3d 233 (2002). This case does not\ninvolve either of those limited exceptions. Thus, we decline\nto address the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 challenge in their first\nassignment of error to the trial court\u2019s denial of their motion\nfor summary judgment seeking prejudgment interest.\n         In their second assignment of error, plaintiffs chal-\nlenge a limited judgment of the trial court declining to award\nthem costs on their claims against Hartford. Plaintiffs con-\ntend that, because attorney fees to which they are entitled\nunder ORS 742.061(1) are awarded \u201cas part of the costs of\nthe action,\u201d they are necessarily entitled to costs. We do not\nagree. ORCP 68 authorizes a court to award costs to a pre-\nvailing party. Having settled their contract claims against\nHartford and voluntarily dismissed their tort claims, we\nagree with Hartford that it was within the trial court\u2019s dis-\ncretion to determine whether plaintiffs prevailed in their\naction and were entitled to costs; the trial court did not\nabuse its discretion in determining that plaintiffs did not\nprevail in their action. See ORCP 54 A(3).2\n         We move on to Hartford\u2019s cross-appeal, in which\nHartford challenges the limited judgment awarding to\nplaintiffs attorney fees based on a percentage of plaintiffs\u2019\nrecovery rather than based on an hourly rate. What consti-\ntutes reasonable attorney fees is within the sound discre-\ntion of the court ordering the fee award. See ORS 20.075(3)\n(providing that \u201cthe decision of the court as to the amount\nof the award\u201d is reviewed for \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d). Hartford\n   2\n     ORCP 54 A(3)provides:\n       \u201cWhen an action is dismissed under this section, the judgment may\n   include any costs and disbursements, including attorney fees, provided by\n   contract, statute, or rule. Unless the circumstances indicate otherwise, the\n   dismissed party shall be considered the prevailing party.\u201d\n\f46      Griffith v. Property and Casualty Ins. Co. of Hartford\n\ndoes not dispute that plaintiffs were entitled to attorney fees\nunder ORS 742.061(1), which provides:\n     \u201c[I]f settlement is not made within six months from the\n     date proof of loss is filed with an insurer and an action is\n     brought in any court of this state upon any policy of insur-\n     ance of any kind or nature, and the plaintiff\u2019s recovery\n     exceeds the amount of any tender made by the defendant\n     in such action, a reasonable amount to be fixed by the court\n     as attorney fees shall be taxed as part of the costs of the\n     action and any appeal thereon.\u201d\n(Emphasis added.) Hartford acknowledges that plaintiffs\nwere entitled to attorney fees, because Hartford did not pay\nplaintiffs for the full loss within six months from the date\nof proof of loss. Hartford only disputes the basis on which\nthe trial court calculated the attorney fees and the amount\nawarded.\n         ORS 20.075 outlines a number of factors that the\ncourt must consider in setting a reasonable fee within its\ndiscretion, such as the time and labor required in the pro-\nceeding and the results obtained. Thoens v. Safeco Ins. Co.,\n317 Or App 727, 744, 507 P3d 284, adh\u2019d to as modified on\nrecons, 319 Or App 450, 508 P3d 1001 (2022) (\u201cA court has\nthe discretion to determine what amounts to a reasonable\nfee by considering the factors in ORS 20.075(1) and (2). ORS\n20.075(3) (providing that \u2018the decision of the court as to the\namount of the award\u2019 is reviewed for \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019)).\nHartford does not dispute that determining the amount\nof fees was within the trial court\u2019s discretion and that we\nreview that determination for an abuse of discretion. But\nHartford contends that, under the circumstances of this\ncase, the trial court abused its discretion in basing the fee\naward on a percentage of plaintiffs\u2019 recovery on their insur-\nance claim rather than on the \u201clodestar\u201d calculation\u2014a fee\nbased on an hourly rate. We agree with Hartford that, under\nthe circumstances here, the trial court abused its discretion\nin determining that a percentage of recovery was a reason-\nable basis on which calculate the amount of the attorney fee.\n        In any case in which an award of attorney fees is\nauthorized or required by statute, ORS 20.075(2) requires\nthe court to consider the factors in ORS 20.075(1) and\n\fCite as 339 Or App 40 (2025)                                      47\n\n20.075(2) in determining a reasonable amount of the fee. In\nFriends of Columbia Gorge v. Energy Fac. Siting Coun., 367\nOr 258, 267, 477 P3d 1191 (2020), the court stated,\n   \u201cThose factors are frequently captured by the \u2018lodestar\u2019\n   approach, under which a fee award is \u2018based on a reason-\n   able hourly rate, multiplied by a reasonable number of\n   hours devoted to work on the case, with certain adjust-\n   ments potentially made to that amount for factors such\n   as the risk of loss and the quality of the attorney\u2019s work.\u2019\n   Strawn[ v. Farmers Ins. Co., 353 Or 210, 217, 297 P3d 439\n   (2013)].\u201d\nIn contrast to the lodestar method, under which the fee is\ndetermined based on a reasonable hourly rate multiplied by\na reasonable number of hours devoted to work on the case,\nwith possible adjustments for factors such as the risk of loss\nand the quality of the attorney\u2019s work, the percent-of-recov-\nery method sets the fee by calculating the total recovery\nsecured by the attorney and awarding a reasonable per-\ncentage of that recovery. In general, the lodestar method\nis thought to more directly account for the amount of work\ndone; the percent-of-recovery method more directly reflects\nthe result achieved. Strawn, 353 Or at 219 (discussing the\ntwo approaches in the context of class-action claims involv-\ning fee-shifting statutes and common funds). The lodestar\nmethod is the prevailing method for determining the rea-\nsonableness of a fee award in cases, such as this, involv-\ning a statutory fee-shifting award, even when, as here, the\ninsured has retained counsel on a contingency-fee basis. Id.\nThe percentage-of-fund basis is a particularly appropriate\nmethod when there is a risk of recovery, when litigation has\nbeen extensive, or when the recovery involves a common\nfund from which attorney fees can be paid. See id. at 221.\n          Whichever method for the calculation of an award\nof fees is chosen, the amount awarded under ORS 742.061(1)\nmust be reasonable; a windfall award of attorney fees is to\nbe avoided. See ZRZ Realty v. Beneficial Fire and Casualty\nIns. Co., 255 Or App 524, 556-57, 300 P3d 1224 (2013) (The\n\u201cpotential for a windfall\u201d in an award of attorney fees \u201cis a\nfactor that the court can consider in setting a reasonable\nattorney fee.\u201d). Here, for the following reasons, we agree\nwith Hartford that the award the trial court made based on\n\f48    Griffith v. Property and Casualty Ins. Co. of Hartford\n\na percentage of plaintiffs\u2019 insurance recovery resulted in a\nwindfall that plaintiffs failed to establish was reasonable.\n          There was never a dispute or litigation as to\nHartford\u2019s liability for coverage of plaintiffs\u2019 insurance\nclaim; the claim was immediately accepted by Hartford, and\nwhen plaintiffs retained their attorney and filed this action,\nHartford had already made several payments and was con-\ntinuing to adjust the claim. And because, before plaintiffs\u2019\ncounsel was retained, the claim had not fully resolved within\nsix months of proof of loss, there was never doubt that an\nattorney retained by plaintiffs would be entitled to fees\nunder ORS 742.061(1), because Hartford had not made a\ntender of the full amount that it ultimately paid under the\npolicy. Because plaintiffs\u2019 counsel did not keep time records,\nthere is no evidence, other than filings, as to how much time\nhe spent on the case. Prior to the parties\u2019 settlement and\nrelease, there was minimal litigation by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\n(the filing of a complaint) with respect to plaintiffs\u2019 claims\nagainst Hartford. A delay in adjusting plaintiffs\u2019 claim was\ncaused by circumstances outside of the parties\u2019 control,\nincluding plaintiffs\u2019 remote location, winter weather, the dif-\nficulty locating a contractor to do cleanup, and the pandemic.\nBut there was never a risk that plaintiffs would not receive\nbenefits under the policy or that their attorney would not be\nentitled to a reasonable attorney fee under ORS 742.061(1).\nThe case was not complex. It did not involve a \u201ccommon fund,\u201d\nwhich might justify a fee based on the percentage of recov-\nery. See Strawn 353 Or at 217. And despite having agreed to\ndo so in his fee agreement with plaintiffs, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\ndid not keep or provide time records of the hours spent on the\nclaim against Hartford, against which the trial court could\nhave evaluated whether the lodestar method would be suffi-\ncient to reasonably compensate plaintiffs\u2019 counsel.\n         Plaintiffs, as the party seeking an award of fees,\nhad the burden of establishing the reasonableness of the fee\namount under either method. Hillsboro v. Maint. & Const.\nServ., 269 Or 169, 172, 523 P2d 1036 (1974) (where oppos-\ning party objects to attorney fee request, burden of proving\nreasonableness of fees rests on party seeking them). In light\nof the above-described circumstances, we conclude that the\n\fCite as 339 Or App 40 (2025)                               49\n\nrecord does not permit a conclusion that plaintiffs estab-\nlished the reasonableness of a fee award based on a percent-\nage of recovery, and that it was therefore an abuse of discre-\ntion by the trial court to determine that plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\nshould receive a fee under ORS 742.061(1) as a percentage of\nplaintiffs\u2019 recovery under the policy rather than under the\nlodestar method. We therefore reverse the award of attorney\nfees in the limited judgment and remand for reconsideration\nof the fee award.\n         On appeal of limited judgment, denial of costs\naffirmed; on appeal of supplemental judgment, appeal dis-\nmissed; on cross-appeal, limited judgment awarding attor-\nney fees reversed and remanded.\n\f",

J.\n         Petitioner appeals a judgment denying her petition\nfor post-conviction relief, raising five assignments of error.\nIn the first four assignments, she asserts that \u201cthe post-\nconviction court erred when it denied relief on petitioner\u2019s\nclaim that trial counsel was ineffective and inadequate for\nfailing to conduct a reasonable investigation.\u201d In the fifth\nassignment, she asserts that \u201cthe post-conviction court\nerred when it denied relief on petitioner\u2019s claim that trial\ncounsel was ineffective and inadequate for failing to use\nan interpreter when discussing with petitioner the decision\nto plead guilty and for failing to provide petitioner with a\ntranslated copy of the plea petition.\u201d With respect to each\nof the claims at issue on appeal, the post-conviction court\ndetermined that petitioner had failed to meet her burden\nof proof. Accepting the post-conviction court\u2019s supported\nimplicit and explicit factual findings and reviewing for legal\nerror, Green v. Franke, 357 Or 301, 312, 350 P3d 188 (2015),\nwe affirm.\n          A petitioner claiming inadequate assistance of coun-\nsel under Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution\nhas the burden \u201cto show, by a preponderance of the evidence,\nfacts demonstrating that trial counsel failed to exercise rea-\nsonable professional skill and judgment and that petitioner\nsuffered prejudice as a result.\u201d Trujillo v.

Under the federal standard,\na petitioner is required to \u201cshow that counsel\u2019s representa-\ntion fell below an objective standard of reasonableness\u201d and\nthat, as a result, the petitioner was prejudiced. Strickland v.\nWashington, 466 US 668, 687-88, 692, 104 S Ct 2052, 80 L\nEd 2d 674 (1984). Those standards are \u201cfunctionally equiv-\nalent.\u201d Montez v.

Before turning to our analysis of petitioner\u2019s assign-\nments of error, we consider whether there is a factual error\nin the post-conviction court\u2019s judgment that requires that\nwe remand: Petitioner points out that the post-conviction\ncourt found that petitioner was not credible, because \u201ceither\nshe lied to the Trial Court when she admitted hitting the\n\f160                                             Kim v.

The state responds that, although the\npost-conviction court\u2019s finding related to credibility noted\nabove was \u201cworded imprecisely,\u201d the post-conviction court\n\u201cwas simply making the general observation that petition-\ner\u2019s assertion of innocence in post-conviction was incon-\nsistent with her guilty plea, where she had acknowledged\nresponsibility.\u201d\n        We agree with the state that one sentence in the\npost-conviction court\u2019s nearly eight-page judgment is\n\u201cworded imprecisely,\u201d but for three contextual reasons, we\ndisagree with petitioner that there is a factual error in the\npost-conviction court\u2019s ruling that requires that we remand.\n         Two pieces of context are petitioner\u2019s testimony\nduring the post-conviction proceeding and the state\u2019s argu-\nment based on that evidence: During the post-conviction pro-\nceeding, petitioner was questioned during direct examination,\non cross-examination, and on redirect examination about\nwhether she caused injuries to the victim. She responded\nto those questions with denials, and she asserted a lack of\nknowledge about whether she caused the injuries at issue.\n         Then, during its closing argument, the state\npointed to petitioner\u2019s responses to questions regarding\nwhether she had caused the victim injuries to argue that\nthe post-conviction court should find her not to be credi-\nble.

It\nthen used that juxtaposition to determine that petitioner\nwas not credible during the post-conviction proceeding.\nSpecifically, in response to petitioner\u2019s claim that trial coun-\nsel provided \u201cinadequate assistance by pressuring Petitioner\nto plead guilty to two counts of Assault in the Second Degree\nConstituting Domestic Violence, when she was not guilty of\neither count,\u201d the post-conviction court found petitioner \u201cnot\ncredible\u201d because petitioner admitted to the trial court during\nher plea colloquy that \u201cshe had struck the victim with the golf\nclub,\u201d but \u201cnow denies causing any of the victim\u2019s injuries,\u201d\nwhich is \u201ccontradicted by the written plea agreement and her\nstatements at entry of plea, as well as medical evidence.\u201d\n         That is, in the post-conviction judgment, we under-\nstand the post-conviction court to have agreed with the\nstate\u2019s argument that petitioner was not credible at the\npost-conviction proceeding because she denied injuring the\nvictim when she struck him with the golf club.\n         Just as we instruct trial courts that \u201cappellate tag\nlines must be read in the context of the opinion as whole,\u201d\nState v.

United States, 582 US 357, 364-65, 137 S Ct\n1958, 198 L Ed 2d 476 (2017) (holding that, under the Sixth\n\fNonprecedential Memo Op: 339 Or App 158 (2025)           163\n\nAmendment to the United States Constitution, \u201cwhen a\ndefendant claims that his counsel\u2019s deficient performance\ndeprived him of a trial by causing him to accept a plea, the\ndefendant can show prejudice by demonstrating a reason-\nable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not\nhave pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to\ntrial\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n         That is, the evidence that trial counsel could have\nobtained was unlikely to have changed the outcome of a\ntrial. See Saroian v. State of Oregon, 154 Or App 112, 118,\n961 P2d 252 (1998) (\u201c[W]here the alleged error of counsel is\na failure to investigate or discover potentially exculpatory\nevidence, the determination whether the error \u2018prejudiced\u2019\nthe defendant by causing him to plead guilty rather than go\nto trial will depend on the likelihood that discovery of the\nevidence would have led counsel to change his recommenda-\ntion as to the plea. This assessment, in turn, will depend in\nlarge part on a prediction whether the evidence would have\nchanged the outcome of a trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks\nand emphases omitted.)). And the record supports the post-\nconviction court\u2019s implicit finding that the evidence that\npetitioner contends trial counsel should have discovered\nwith reasonable investigation would not have resulted in a\nbetter plea offer from the state.

We turn to\npetitioner\u2019s fifth assignment of error, in which she contends\nthat \u201cthe post-conviction court erred when it denied relief\non petitioner\u2019s claim that trial counsel was ineffective and\ninadequate for failing to use an interpreter when discuss-\ning with petitioner the decision to plead guilty and for fail-\ning to provide petitioner with a translated copy of the plea\n\f164                                             Kim v. Brown\n\npetition.\u201d Petitioner asserts that, because trial counsel was\nineffective and inadequate in that way, her plea was not\nknowing, intelligent, and voluntary.\n         The post-conviction court determined that \u201cno evi-\ndence was provided to support this claim.\u201d And even assum-\ning that trial counsel\u2019s performance was inadequate, we\nconclude that petitioner did not establish prejudice: As an\ninitial matter, petitioner was actively involved in plea nego-\ntiations, trial counsel discussed the plea in detail with peti-\ntioner, and trial counsel averred that petitioner understood\nhim adequately when unaided by an interpreter.\n         Moreover, an interpreter was present at petitioner\u2019s\nplea hearing. And at that hearing, petitioner confirmed to\nthe trial court that she \u201cread the plea petition [or] had it\ntranslated into her native language,\u201d that she \u201cunder[stood]\nthe plea petition,\u201d that she had \u201can adequate opportunity\nto review the plea petition, * * * court processes, and [her]\ndecision to enter a guilty plea with [her] attorney,\u201d and that\nshe \u201cunderstood what it is [she] was doing by pleading guilty\nto two counts of assault in the second degree.\u201d She also con-\nfirmed that she did not \u201cneed more time to speak\u201d with her\nattorney before the court accepted her guilty pleas and that\nshe was \u201cin fact guilty of two counts of assault in the sec-\nond degree as domestic violence offenses.\u201d Based on those\nresponses, the trial court accepted petitioner\u2019s guilty plea.\n         Finally, petitioner did not produce evidence that she\nwas confused about any of the specific rights that she was\nwaiving by entering a plea or about the specific terms of\nthe plea itself. See Wilson v. Armenakis, 144 Or App 587,\n589, 928 P2d 354 (1996), rev den, 324 Or 560 (1997) (reject-\ning post-conviction petitioner\u2019s claim that his plea was not\nknowing and voluntary, where post-conviction court found\nthat the \u201cpetitioner executed a plea petition that set out the\nrights that he was waiving,\u201d that \u201ctrial counsel read the peti-\ntion to petitioner before he entered his guilty plea,\u201d and that,\n\u201cbefore accepting the plea, the trial court assured itself that\npetitioner\u2019s plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent\u201d).\n        Affirmed.\n\f",

We affirm.\n           We review the grant of an ORCP 21 motion to dis-\nmiss for legal error, Hernandez v. Catholic Health Initiatives,\n311 Or App 70, 72, 490 P3d 166 (2021), assuming \u201cthat all\nwell-pleaded facts are true and giv[ing] plaintiff the bene-\nfit of all favorable inferences that reasonably may be drawn\nfrom those factual allegations,\u201d Piazza v. Kellim, 360 Or 58,\n61, 377 P3d 492 (2016).1\n          Plaintiff entered Mt. Tabor Park, a city park owned\nby defendant, to recreate and \u201cwalk its trails.\u201d While walk-\ning on a paved road toward the exit of the park, plain-\ntiff stepped into a hole in the pavement and was severely\ninjured. Plaintiff sued defendant for negligence, and defen-\ndant moved to dismiss on the ground that, based on plain-\ntiff\u2019s complaint, the affirmative defense of recreational use\nimmunity applied and barred plaintiff\u2019s claim. See ORS\n105.682 (limiting liability of owner of land for certain inju-\nries that arise out of recreational use).2 The trial court\nagreed with defendant and dismissed plaintiff\u2019s complaint\nwith prejudice and denied her motion to replead, reasoning\n    1\n      The parties do not address, and we do not decide, whether ORCP 21 A is the\ncorrect procedural vehicle for the affirmative defense of recreational use immu-\nnity. Compare ORCP 21 A(1) (listing enumerated defenses available in motion to\ndismiss) with ORCP 19 B (listing defenses that a party \u201cshall\u201d plead, including\n\u201cany other matter constituting an * * * affirmative defense).\n    2\n      The recreational use immunity statute, ORS 105.682, in relevant part, pro-\nvides that:\n    \u201can owner of land is not liable in contract or tort for any personal injury,\n    death or property damage that arises out of the use of the land for recre-\n    ational purposes * * * when the owner of land either directly or indirectly\n    permits any person to use the land for recreational purposes * * *. The limita-\n    tion on liability provided by this section applies if the principal purpose for\n    entry upon the land is for recreational purposes * * * and is not affected if the\n    injury, death or damage occurs while the person entering land is engaging in\n    activities other than the use of the land for recreational purposes[.]\u201d\n\f102                                 Laxer v. City of Portland\n\nthat any amendment would be futile. On appeal, plaintiff\nasserts that the trial court erred in ruling that recreational\nuse immunity applied and in denying plaintiff the opportu-\nnity to replead her complaint.\n         First Assignment of Error. Plaintiff first assigns\nerror to the trial court\u2019s grant of defendant\u2019s motion to dis-\nmiss on the ground that recreational use immunity applied.\nOn appeal, plaintiff asserts three arguments: (1) defen-\ndant\u2019s affirmative actions in paving the roads and walk-\nways in Mt. Tabor and representing to the public that those\nroads and walkways were \u201caccessible\u201d constitute intentional\nconduct which renders recreational use immunity unavail-\nable to defendant, ORS 105.682(2) (\u201cThis section does not\nlimit the liability of an owner of land for intentional injury\nor damage.\u201d); (2) the elements of recreational use immunity\nwere not met, because plaintiff was not engaged in a recre-\national purpose at the time of her injury; and (3) the roads\nand paths of Mt. Tabor are like a public sidewalk\u2014which\nfall outside the scope of recreational immunity, because\nthey are used by the public for various purposes. See Landis\nv. Limbaugh, 282 Or App 284, 294, 385 P3d 1139 (2016),\nrev dismissed, 361 Or 351 (2017) (recreational use immunity\nunavailable to defendant for injury that occurred on regular\npedestrian sidewalk).\n         We do not address plaintiff\u2019s first argument, as it is\nunpreserved. See Summit RWP, Inc. v. Hallin, 334 Or App\n529, 535, 557 P3d 1113 (2024) (generally we will not consider\nargument based on new theory for the first time on appeal);\nJohn Hyland Const., Inc. v. Williamsen & Bleid, Inc., 287\nOr App 466, 471, 402 P3d 719 (2017) (\u201c[T]he purpose of an\nappeal is not to give the appellant an opportunity to pursue\na new theory that it did not rely on below.\u201d). And, assuming\nthat plaintiff\u2019s second argument is preserved, it is foreclosed\nby the text of the recreational use immunity statute and con-\ntrolling case law. Coleman v. Oregon Parks and Recreation\nDept., 347 Or 94, 102, 217 P3d 651 (2009) (noting that rec-\nreational use immunity extends \u201cas long as the injured per-\nson\u2019s principal purpose for entry is recreational, even if the\nperson was engaged in other nonrecreational activity at the\ntime of injury\u201d (citing ORS 105.682(1))).\n\fCite as 339 Or App 100 (2025)                                 103\n\nPlaintiff\u2019s last argument, as we understand it, is that (1) the\npaved walkways in Mt. Tabor are like the paved sidewalks\nto which recreational immunity did not apply in Landis and\n(2) the application of recreational immunity to some inju-\nries and not others would produce irrational results that we\nsought to avoid in Landis. 282 Or App at 295.\nPlaintiff extends Landis too far: although we held there that\ncertain kinds of generally available public land, like side-\nwalks, would be outside the scope of recreational use immu-\nnity, we expressly noted that some generally available land\nconnected with recreation would still be subject to immunity:\n   \u201cNowhere in legislative history do we find any suggestion\n   that recreational immunity would apply to streets or side-\n   walks that are already generally available to the public,\n   that are not attendant to parks or places of recreation, and\n   that the landowner has done nothing to \u2018make available\u2019 for\n   the statutorily specified recreational or similar uses.\u201d\nId. at 294 (emphasis added); see also Waggoner v. City of\nWoodburn, 196 Or App 715, 717, 103 P3d 648 (2004) (recre-\national use immunity applies to public city parks).\n          Lastly, we address a new, unbriefed argument,\nbrought up by plaintiff at oral argument for the first time,\nthat the location where plaintiff was injured\u2014a paved\naccess road within Mt. Tabor Park\u2014makes recreational use\nimmunity inapplicable to defendant. See ORS 105.688(1)(c)\n(2021), amended by Or Laws 2024, ch 64 \u00a7 7 (recreational\nuse immunity applies to \u201c[a]ll paths, trails, roads, * * * and\nother rights of way\u201d used to access land to recreate \u201cthat\nhave not been improved, designed or maintained for the spe-\ncific purpose of providing access for recreational purposes\u201d).\nThat new argument relies on Fields v. City of Newport, 326\nOr App 764, 533 P3d 384, rev den, 371 Or 476 (2023), in\nwhich we concluded that recreational use immunity would\nnot apply to a paved beach access trail used solely for access\nto the beach. Id. at 775. Although we are under no obligation\nto address that argument, we observe that it is foreclosed by\nour recent decision in Murphy v. City of Cannon Beach, 338\nOr App 104, 106-08, 108 n 2, ___ P3d ___ (2025) (holding\nthat ORS 105.688(1)(c) (2021) \u201cis relevant only where a plain-\ntiff is injured on land adjacent to the land that the person\n\f104                                Laxer v. City of Portland\n\nintends to use for recreational purposes\u201d (emphasis added)),\nand we decline to address it further, see ORAP 6.15(6) (\u201cIt\nis the general policy of Oregon appellate courts to prohibit\nreference at oral argument to any authority not cited either\nin a brief or in a pre-argument memorandum of additional\nauthorities.\u201d).\n          Second Assignment of Error. Plaintiff next contends\nthat the trial court erred by denying leave to amend her\ncomplaint. Plaintiff requested leave to amend \u201cin order to\nmore fully allege her purpose for being on the walkway in\nMt. Tabor, and to more fully articulate her position that the\nCity\u2019s affirmative acts and conduct were such that [plain-\ntiff] relied on the City\u2019s representations to her detriment.\u201d\n         We review a court\u2019s denial of leave to amend after\nan ORCP 21 A dismissal for an abuse of discretion. Caldeen\nConstruction v. Kemp, 248 Or App 82, 86, 273 P3d 174 (2012).\nA trial court\u2019s discretion to grant or deny motions to amend\na complaint after a motion to dismiss is not limitless; it is\nbounded by the requirement that motions to amend should\nbe liberally granted if amendment would preclude the entry\nof a judgment. Id.

Tabor Park, a city park owned\nby defendant, to recreate and \u201cwalk its trails.\u201d While walk-\ning on a paved road toward the exit of the park, plain-\ntiff stepped into a hole in the pavement and was severely\ninjured. Plaintiff sued defendant for negligence, and defen-\ndant moved to dismiss on the ground that, based on plain-\ntiff\u2019s complaint, the affirmative defense of recreational use\nimmunity applied and barred plaintiff\u2019s claim. See ORS\n105.682 (limiting liability of owner of land for certain inju-\nries that arise out of recreational use).2 The trial court\nagreed with defendant and dismissed plaintiff\u2019s complaint\nwith prejudice and denied her motion to replead, reasoning\n    1\n      The parties do not address, and we do not decide, whether ORCP 21 A is the\ncorrect procedural vehicle for the affirmative defense of recreational use immu-\nnity. Compare ORCP 21 A(1) (listing enumerated defenses available in motion to\ndismiss) with ORCP 19 B (listing defenses that a party \u201cshall\u201d plead, including\n\u201cany other matter constituting an * * * affirmative defense).\n    2\n      The recreational use immunity statute, ORS 105.682, in relevant part, pro-\nvides that:\n    \u201can owner of land is not liable in contract or tort for any personal injury,\n    death or property damage that arises out of the use of the land for recre-\n    ational purposes * * * when the owner of land either directly or indirectly\n    permits any person to use the land for recreational purposes * * *. The limita-\n    tion on liability provided by this section applies if the principal purpose for\n    entry upon the land is for recreational purposes * * * and is not affected if the\n    injury, death or damage occurs while the person entering land is engaging in\n    activities other than the use of the land for recreational purposes[.]\u201d\n\f102                                 Laxer v. City of Portland\n\nthat any amendment would be futile. On appeal, plaintiff\nasserts that the trial court erred in ruling that recreational\nuse immunity applied and in denying plaintiff the opportu-\nnity to replead her complaint.\n         First Assignment of Error. Plaintiff first assigns\nerror to the trial court\u2019s grant of defendant\u2019s motion to dis-\nmiss on the ground that recreational use immunity applied.\nOn appeal, plaintiff asserts three arguments: (1) defen-\ndant\u2019s affirmative actions in paving the roads and walk-\nways in Mt. Tabor and representing to the public that those\nroads and walkways were \u201caccessible\u201d constitute intentional\nconduct which renders recreational use immunity unavail-\nable to defendant, ORS 105.682(2) (\u201cThis section does not\nlimit the liability of an owner of land for intentional injury\nor damage.\u201d); (2) the elements of recreational use immunity\nwere not met, because plaintiff was not engaged in a recre-\national purpose at the time of her injury; and (3) the roads\nand paths of Mt. Tabor are like a public sidewalk\u2014which\nfall outside the scope of recreational immunity, because\nthey are used by the public for various purposes. See Landis\nv.

J.\n         Petitioner appeals a judgment denying his petition\nfor post-conviction relief from convictions for aggravated\nmurder with a firearm, attempted aggravated murder with\na firearm, first-degree assault with a firearm, second-degree\nassault with a firearm, and one count of unlawful use of a\nweapon. Petitioner was represented by a team of two attor-\nneys at trial. He alleges that his criminal trial counsel were\nconstitutionally inadequate and ineffective in a variety of\nrespects, and that the post-conviction court erred in deny-\ning relief on the alleged grounds of inadequacy and inef-\nfectiveness. We review the post-conviction court\u2019s denial of\npost-conviction relief for legal error, accepting the court\u2019s\nsupported implicit and explicit factual findings. Green v.\nFranke, 357 Or 301, 312, 350 P3d 188 (2015). Reviewing\nunder those standards, we affirm.\n          Legal Standards. At issue in this matter are par-\nallel claims of inadequate assistance of trial counsel under\nArticle I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution, and ineffec-\ntive assistance of trial counsel under the Sixth Amendment\nto the United States Constitution. To establish that his trial\ncounsel rendered inadequate assistance for purposes of\nArticle I, section 11, petitioner was required to prove two ele-\nments: (1) a performance element\u2014that trial counsel \u201cfailed\nto exercise reasonable professional skill and judgment\u201d; and\n(2) a prejudice element\u2014that \u201cpetitioner suffered prejudice\nas a result of counsel\u2019s inadequacy.\u201d Johnson v. Premo, 361\nOr 688, 699, 399 P3d 431 (2017). A functionally equivalent\ntwo-element standard governs petitioner\u2019s claim of ineffec-\ntive assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment. Id.\nTo prevail on that claim, petitioner was required to demon-\nstrate that \u201ctrial counsel\u2019s performance \u2018fell below an objec-\ntive standard of reasonableness\u2019 \u201d and also that \u201cthere was a\n\u2018reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional\nerrors, the result of the proceeding would have been differ-\nent.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 700 (quoting Strickland v. Washington, 466 US\n668, 694, 104 S Ct 2052, 80 L Ed 2d 674 (1984)).\n        Failure to File Motion to Suppress. In his first\nassignment of error, which is the only assignment of error\nasserted in the brief filed by counsel, petitioner contends\n\fNonprecedential Memo Op: 339 Or App 151 (2025)           153\n\nthat the post-conviction court erred by denying relief on his\nclaim that his trial counsel were inadequate and ineffective\nfor not moving to suppress statements that he made in a\npost-arrest interview. In denying relief, the post-conviction\ncourt credited petitioner\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s explanation as to\nwhy they did not move to suppress\u2014that parts of the inter-\nview would support petitioner\u2019s trial strategy of claiming\nself-defense, and that they did not have a basis to move\nto suppress the statements that petitioner made before he\nclearly invoked his Miranda rights. On this record, as the\npost-conviction court correctly concluded, neither of those\nassessments represents a failure to exercise reasonable pro-\nfessional skill and judgment.\n          It was not unreasonable for petitioner\u2019s trial coun-\nsel to think that the statements could buttress petition-\ner\u2019s self-defense strategy. Trial counsel reasoned that one\nof petitioner\u2019s statements in the interview\u2014\u201dthey go on\nme\u201d\u2014was consistent with his claim of self-defense and was\nimportant because of its timing. Because petitioner made it\nto the police soon after the shooting, it could demonstrate\nthat petitioner had not changed his story after the fact.\n          It also was not unreasonable for petitioner\u2019s trial\ncounsel to think that a motion to suppress would not have\nsucceeded. Although petitioner contends that reasonable\ncounsel would have argued that petitioner\u2019s statement that\n\u201cI don\u2019t know nothin\u2019 about nothin\u2019 \u201d was an invocation of his\nMiranda right to remain silent, on its face, the statement is\na disclaimer of knowledge that does not state or imply that\npetitioner did not want to talk to police. It therefore stands\nin stark contrast with the statements that the Supreme\nCourt and we have deemed to be unequivocal or equivocal\ninvocations of the Miranda right to remain silent, which\ncontain some reference to speaking. See State v. Nichols,\n361 Or 101, 104, 107, 390 P3d 1001 (2017) (concluding that\n\u201cit\u2019s not something I want to talk about\u201d was an unequivo-\ncal invocation of the right to remain silent); State v. Rose,\n296 Or App 99, 102, 108, 437 P3d 1144 (2019) (concluding\nthat \u201cI don\u2019t have nothing to say\u201d was an equivocal invo-\ncation). Given that contrast, petitioners\u2019 trial counsel rea-\nsonably could conclude that petitioner\u2019s statement, \u201cI don\u2019t\n\f154                                      Richardson v. Cain\n\nknow nothin\u2019 about nothin\u2019,\u201d would not support a motion to\nsuppress premised on the theory that the statement invoked\npetitioner\u2019s Miranda rights and reasonably decline to pur-\nsue such a motion.\n         Failure to Seek Exclusion of Evidence That the Gun\nWas Stolen. In his first pro se supplemental assignment,\npetitioner contends that trial counsel were inadequate and\nineffective for not moving in limine to exclude evidence that\nthe gun that petitioner used to shoot the victims was stolen.\nThe post-conviction court denied relief on this claim for a\nrange of reasons, including that petitioner did not demon-\nstrate that the inclusion of the evidence prejudiced him:\n\u201cPetitioner did not prove that the introduction of evidence\nthat [p]etitioner had stolen the gun used in the shooting\ncould have had a tendency to affect the outcome of the trial.\u201d\nOn review of the record, we agree with that conclusion.\nGiven the evidence of petitioner\u2019s conduct, and the minimal\nemphasis placed on how petitioner acquired the gun, it is\nunlikely that the evidence had any tendency to affect the\njury\u2019s decision.\n         Failure to Call Memory Expert. In his second pro\nse supplemental assignment, petitioner contends that his\ntrial counsel were inadequate and ineffective for not calling\na memory expert as a witness at trial to explain petition-\ner\u2019s trial testimony that he did not remember pulling out\nhis gun, pulling the trigger, or shooting anyone. The post-\nconviction court denied relief on this claim based on its fac-\ntual findings that petitioner had not told his attorneys that\nhe did not remember his conduct, and, on multiple occasions,\ngave detailed descriptions of the events leading to the shoot-\nings. This led the post-conviction court to the conclusion\nthat trial counsel had no reason to foresee the need for a\nmemory expert. Those findings are supported by the record\nand preclude the conclusion that counsel\u2019s omission to call a\nmemory expert represents a failure to exercise reasonable\nprofessional skill and judgment. Green, 357 Or at 312 (sup-\nported findings of fact binding on appellate court). Absent\nevidence that petitioner had memory issues as counsel pre-\npared for trial, there was no reason for counsel to consult a\nmemory expert.\n\fNonprecedential Memo Op: 339 Or App 151 (2025)             155\n\n         Failure to Call Self-Defense Expert. In his third pro\nse supplemental assignment, petitioner assigns error to the\npost-conviction court\u2019s denial of relief on his claim that coun-\nsel were inadequate and ineffective for not calling as a wit-\nness Bedard, an expert they had hired to support petition-\ner\u2019s claim of self-defense. Counsel hired Bedard to observe\npetitioner\u2019s testimony at trial and then provide expert tes-\ntimony as to how it was consistent with self-defense. After\npetitioner testified at trial that he did not remember pulling\nthe trigger or shooting people, the trial court imposed sig-\nnificant limitations on Bedard\u2019s potential testimony, includ-\ning prohibiting him from opining on self-defense or on peti-\ntioner\u2019s response to the situation he was in. It was under\nthose circumstances that counsel decided not to call Bedard\nand so trial counsels\u2019 decision was a reasonable one because,\ngiven the trial court\u2019s limitations, the testimony would have\ndone little, if anything, to advance the defense.\n        Petitioner also contends that trial counsel failed to\nproperly prepare Bedard for trial. But as the superintendent\npoints out, that particular claim is not preserved. Beyond\nthat, we note that it is not clear what counsel could have\ndone to prepare Bedard for trial, given the substantial and\nunanticipated change in petitioner\u2019s story once he took the\nstand.\n         Failure to Adequately Advise Petitioner. In his\nfourth pro se supplemental assignment, petitioner assigns\nerror the post-conviction court\u2019s denial of relief on his claim\nthat trial counsel were inadequate and ineffective in advis-\ning him regarding the possibility of the death penalty and\npotential issues of appeal. Petitioner asserts that counsels\u2019\ninadequate advice prejudiced him by causing him to waive\nhis right to appeal and stipulate to a sentence of life without\nparole, when he otherwise would not have agreed to stipu-\nlate.

In his first\nassignment of error, which is the only assignment of error\nasserted in the brief filed by counsel, petitioner contends\n\fNonprecedential Memo Op: </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">339 Or App 151</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2025)           153\n\nthat the post-conviction court erred by denying relief on his\nclaim that his trial counsel were inadequate and ineffective\nfor not moving to suppress statements that he made in a\npost-arrest interview. In denying relief, the post-conviction\ncourt credited petitioner\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s explanation as to\nwhy they did not move to suppress\u2014that parts of the inter-\nview would support petitioner\u2019s trial strategy of claiming\nself-defense, and that they did not have a basis to move\nto suppress the statements that petitioner made before he\nclearly invoked his Miranda rights. On this record, as the\npost-conviction court correctly concluded, neither of those\nassessments represents a failure to exercise reasonable pro-\nfessional skill and judgment.\n          It was not unreasonable for petitioner\u2019s trial coun-\nsel to think that the statements could buttress petition-\ner\u2019s self-defense strategy. Trial counsel reasoned that one\nof petitioner\u2019s statements in the interview\u2014\u201dthey go on\nme\u201d\u2014was consistent with his claim of self-defense and was\nimportant because of its timing. Because petitioner made it\nto the police soon after the shooting, it could demonstrate\nthat petitioner had not changed his story after the fact.\n          It also was not unreasonable for petitioner\u2019s trial\ncounsel to think that a motion to suppress would not have\nsucceeded. Although petitioner contends that reasonable\ncounsel would have argued that petitioner\u2019s statement that\n\u201cI don\u2019t know nothin\u2019 about nothin\u2019 \u201d was an invocation of his\nMiranda right to remain silent, on its face, the statement is\na disclaimer of knowledge that does not state or imply that\npetitioner did not want to talk to police. It therefore stands\nin stark contrast with the statements that the Supreme\nCourt and we have deemed to be unequivocal or equivocal\ninvocations of the Miranda right to remain silent, which\ncontain some reference to speaking.

Given that contrast, petitioners\u2019 trial counsel rea-\nsonably could conclude that petitioner\u2019s statement, \u201cI don\u2019t\n\f154                                      Richardson v. Cain\n\nknow nothin\u2019 about nothin\u2019,\u201d would not support a motion to\nsuppress premised on the theory that the statement invoked\npetitioner\u2019s Miranda rights and reasonably decline to pur-\nsue such a motion.\n         Failure to Seek Exclusion of Evidence That the Gun\nWas Stolen. In his first pro se supplemental assignment,\npetitioner contends that trial counsel were inadequate and\nineffective for not moving in limine to exclude evidence that\nthe gun that petitioner used to shoot the victims was stolen.\nThe post-conviction court denied relief on this claim for a\nrange of reasons, including that petitioner did not demon-\nstrate that the inclusion of the evidence prejudiced him:\n\u201cPetitioner did not prove that the introduction of evidence\nthat [p]etitioner had stolen the gun used in the shooting\ncould have had a tendency to affect the outcome of the trial.\u201d\nOn review of the record, we agree with that conclusion.\nGiven the evidence of petitioner\u2019s conduct, and the minimal\nemphasis placed on how petitioner acquired the gun, it is\nunlikely that the evidence had any tendency to affect the\njury\u2019s decision.\n         Failure to Call Memory Expert. In his second pro\nse supplemental assignment, petitioner contends that his\ntrial counsel were inadequate and ineffective for not calling\na memory expert as a witness at trial to explain petition-\ner\u2019s trial testimony that he did not remember pulling out\nhis gun, pulling the trigger, or shooting anyone. The post-\nconviction court denied relief on this claim based on its fac-\ntual findings that petitioner had not told his attorneys that\nhe did not remember his conduct, and, on multiple occasions,\ngave detailed descriptions of the events leading to the shoot-\nings. This led the post-conviction court to the conclusion\nthat trial counsel had no reason to foresee the need for a\nmemory expert. Those findings are supported by the record\nand preclude the conclusion that counsel\u2019s omission to call a\nmemory expert represents a failure to exercise reasonable\nprofessional skill and judgment.

In his third pro\nse supplemental assignment, petitioner assigns error to the\npost-conviction court\u2019s denial of relief on his claim that coun-\nsel were inadequate and ineffective for not calling as a wit-\nness Bedard, an expert they had hired to support petition-\ner\u2019s claim of self-defense. Counsel hired Bedard to observe\npetitioner\u2019s testimony at trial and then provide expert tes-\ntimony as to how it was consistent with self-defense. After\npetitioner testified at trial that he did not remember pulling\nthe trigger or shooting people, the trial court imposed sig-\nnificant limitations on Bedard\u2019s potential testimony, includ-\ning prohibiting him from opining on self-defense or on peti-\ntioner\u2019s response to the situation he was in. It was under\nthose circumstances that counsel decided not to call Bedard\nand so trial counsels\u2019 decision was a reasonable one because,\ngiven the trial court\u2019s limitations, the testimony would have\ndone little, if anything, to advance the defense.\n        Petitioner also contends that trial counsel failed to\nproperly prepare Bedard for trial. But as the superintendent\npoints out, that particular claim is not preserved. Beyond\nthat, we note that it is not clear what counsel could have\ndone to prepare Bedard for trial, given the substantial and\nunanticipated change in petitioner\u2019s story once he took the\nstand.\n         Failure to Adequately Advise Petitioner. In his\nfourth pro se supplemental assignment, petitioner assigns\nerror the post-conviction court\u2019s denial of relief on his claim\nthat trial counsel were inadequate and ineffective in advis-\ning him regarding the possibility of the death penalty and\npotential issues of appeal. Petitioner asserts that counsels\u2019\ninadequate advice prejudiced him by causing him to waive\nhis right to appeal and stipulate to a sentence of life without\nparole, when he otherwise would not have agreed to stipu-\nlate. The post-conviction court denied relief on this claim,\nexplaining its reasoning in detail, and finding that peti-\ntioner was advised extensively on the \u201cpluses and minuses\nof the resolution and the effect of waiving appeal.\u201d The post-\nconviction court further found that \u201cThere were no sure-fire\nissues on appeal and [p]etitioner was advised of his chances\non appeal.\u201d\n\f156                                       Richardson v. Cain\n\n         In challenging that ruling on appeal, petitioner\ndoes not dispute the post-conviction court\u2019s factual find-\nings, meaningfully engage with its reasoning, or point to\nany evidence in the record that would compel the court to\nconclude that petitioner met the burden of demonstrating\nthat the advice he received was mistaken or unreasonable.\nHowever, petitioner identifies three issues that he claims\n\u201ccould have been raised on direct appeal\u201d: a Batson issue; a\nmistrial issue; and an issue regarding the limitations that\nthe trial court placed on Bedard\u2019s potential testimony.

J.\n         Youth appeals a juvenile court order requiring him\nto report as a sex offender. He assigns error to the order\nitself and argues that the court applied an erroneous legal\nstandard in assessing whether he met his burden to prove\n\u201cby clear and convincing evidence that [he] is rehabilitated\nand does not pose a threat to the safety of the public,\u201d ORS\n163A.030(7)(b), because the court did not focus on youth\u2019s\ncurrent risk of sexual recidivism. Additionally, youth assigns\nerror to the court\u2019s exclusion of (1) an article about juvenile\nsexual recidivism (the Caldwell article1), (2) an article about\nthe effectiveness of specialized treatment programs for\njuvenile sex offenders (the Kettrey article2), and (3) youth\u2019s\noriginal treatment notebook. Youth argues that his expert\nrelied upon the research articles in her direct and rebuttal\ntestimony and that they were, thus, relevant to her credibil-\nity and conclusions. He argues that the original notebook\nwas relevant because it would allow him to rebut allegations\nthat he had forged certain initials in the notebook and that\nhe provided incomplete copies of the notebook to his benefit.\nAccording to youth, exclusion of the relevant exhibits was\nreversible error.\n         The state does not dispute that the excluded exhib-\nits are relevant. It argues instead that the exhibits were\nproperly excluded as a discretionary sanction for discovery\nviolations. Youth argues that the juvenile court abused its\ndiscretion when it excluded the exhibits because, under ORS\n163A.030(9), the statutory hearing is designed to allow the\njuvenile court to \u201creceive testimony, reports and other evi-\ndence, without regard to whether the evidence is admissible\nunder\u201d the rules of evidence if it is \u201crelated to the determi-\nnation and findings required under\u201d ORS 163A.030.\n        We conclude, for the reasons that follow, that the\nCaldwell and Kettrey articles, and the original treatment\nnotebook, were relevant to the issues before the juvenile\n\n   1\n      Michael F.

With respect to the merits of the court\u2019s decision\nordering youth to report as a sex offender, we conclude that\nthe record did not require it to answer the factual ques-\ntion under ORS 163A.030 in a different way. We, therefore,\naffirm.\n         Youth asks us to conduct de novo review. ORS\n19.415(3)(b) permits us, in our \u201csole discretion,\u201d to \u201ctry the\ncause anew upon the record or [to] make one or more factual\nfindings anew upon the record.\u201d ORAP 5.40(8) describes the\nprocess by which de novo review may be requested, and it\nprovides a nonexclusive and nonbinding list of items that\nwe consider relevant to the decision whether to exercise our\ndiscretion to conduct de novo review, emphasizing that we\nexercise our discretion to conduct de novo review only in\n\u201cexceptional cases.\u201d\n         We recently exercised our discretion to review the\nrecord de novo in two appeals of orders requiring sex offender\nreporting: State v. X. E. W., 331 Or App 1, 2, 546 P3d 288\n(2024) (exercising authority to review the record de novo \u201cin\norder to apply the legal principles outlined in State v. A. R.\nH., 371 Or 82, 530 P3d 897 (2023), which the Supreme Court\nissued after the parties submitted their briefs in this case\u201d)\nand State v. K. L. F., 333 Or App 434, 435, 552 P3d 722\n(2024) (exercising authority to review the record de novo, \u201c[a]\ns we recently did\u201d in X. E. W. because \u201cthe juvenile court\napplied an incorrect standard when assessing youth\u2019s risk\nof recidivism\u201d). This case is similar to both X. E. W. and K.\nL. F. in that the juvenile court ruled on youth\u2019s petition for\nrelief from sex offender requirements before A. R. H. was\npublished. However, this case does not present the same\nconcerns that were present in X. E. W. and K. L. F. about\nthe trial court\u2019s application of the correct legal framework.\nConsequently, we do not exercise our discretion to review\nthis case de novo.\n        We conduct our review of the juvenile court\u2019s order\nrequiring youth to report as a sex offender in accordance\nwith the usual standard of appellate review, recogniz-\ning that the juvenile court\u2019s assigned inquiry under ORS\n\fCite as 339 Or App 134 (2025)                                              137\n\n163A.030(7)(b) is \u201ca factual inquiry.\u201d A. R.

We\nreview the juvenile court\u2019s exclusion of relevant evidence as\nduplicative for abuse of discretion. See State v. Titus, 328 Or\n475, 481, 982 P2d 1133 (1999) (\u201cA decision to exclude evi-\ndence under OEC 403 is reserved to the trial court\u2019s discre-\ntion.\u201d). We conduct our review of the juvenile court\u2019s eviden-\ntiary rulings \u201cin light of the record that was before the court\nat the time of its ruling.\u201d State v. Rodriguez-Delao, 335 Or\nApp 700, 701, 560 P3d 85 (2024).\n         We turn to the pertinent underlying historical\nand procedural facts. The state filed a delinquency petition\nagainst youth, then 16 years of age, alleging that when he\nwas between the ages of 13 and 15, he had engaged in con-\nduct with two younger cousins and a half-sister that, if done\nby an adult, would constitute eight felony sex crimes. The\njuvenile court accepted \u201cAlford pleas\u201d from youth on Counts\n1 and 6, and an admission on Count 7.3 It then determined\n     3\n       Counts 1, 6, and 7 of the amended delinquency petition charged youth as\nfollows:\n     \u201cCount 1 Rape in the First Degree (ORS 163.375) (Class A Felony) The said\n     youth, on, about, or between June 30th, 2015 to June 30th, 2017, in Yamhill\n     County, Oregon, did unlawfully and knowingly engage in sexual intercourse\n     with B.H.P., a child under twelve years of age, said act of youth being con-\n     trary to the statutes in such cases made and provided and against the peace\n     and dignity of the State of Oregon.\n     \u201c* * * * *\n     \u201cCount 6 Attempted Sexual Abuse in the First Degree (ORS 161.405) (ORS\n     163.427) (Class C Felony) The said youth, on, about, or between June 30th,\n\f138                                                          State v. B. J. P.\n\nthat youth was within the delinquency jurisdiction of the\njuvenile court.4\n         An Alford plea is a reference to North Carolina v.\nAlford, 400 US 25, 91 S Ct 160, 27 L Ed 2d 162 (1970). It\nis equivalent to a \u201cno contest\u201d plea under ORS 135.335(1)\n(c). Commentary to Criminal Law Revision Commission\nProposed Oregon Criminal Procedure Code, Final Draft\nand Report \u00a7 252, 149 (Nov 1972). As we recently explained:\n    \u201c \u2018An Alford plea is a guilty plea in which the defendant does\n    not admit commission of the criminal act or asserts that he\n    is innocent.\u2019 State v. Sullivan, 197 Or App 26, 28 n 1, 104\n    P3d 636 (2005), rev den, 340 Or 673 (2006) (concluding that\n    it was not plain error for a trial court to rely on an Alford\n    plea as an admission of facts justifying a sentence enhance-\n    ment). With an Alford plea, a defendant does not admit\n    guilt \u2018but admits that sufficient evidence exists to convict\n    him of the offense.\u2019 United States v. Ramirez-Gonzalez, 755\n    F3d 1267, 1273 (11th Cir 2014).\n        \u201cBefore entering a judgment of conviction from a plea\n    of guilty or no contest, the trial court must \u2018mak[e] such\n    inquiry as may satisfy the court that there is a factual basis\n    for the plea.\u2019 ORS 135.395. The \u2018\u201dfactual basis for the plea\u201d\n    refers to facts concerning the defendant\u2019s guilt\u2014i.e., facts\n    regarding whether the defendant committed the crime to\n    which the defendant is pleading.\u2019 State v. Heisser, 232 Or\n    App 320, 329, 222 P3d 719 (2009).\u201d\nState v. Jackson, 319 Or App 789, 791, 511 P3d 82 (2022). In\nproceeding with Alford pleas, youth chose not to contest that\n    2015 to June 30th, 2017, in Yamhill County, Oregon, did unlawfully and\n    intentionally attempt by forcible compulsion to subject T.T., a child under\n    fourteen years of age, to sexual contact, to wit: causing T.T. to touch said\n    youth\u2019s penis, a sexual or intimate part of said youth, said act of youth being\n    contrary to the statutes in such cases made and provided and against the\n    peace and dignity of the State of Oregon.\n        \u201cCount 7 Attempted Sexual Abuse in the First Degree (ORS 161.405)\n        (ORS 163.427) (Class C Felony) The said youth, on, about, or between\n        October 31st, 2015 to October 31st, 2017, in Yamhill County, Oregon,\n        did unlawfully and intentionally attempt to subject G.C., a child under\n        fourteen years of age, to sexual contact, to wit: touching G.C.\u2019s breasts,\n        a sexual or intimate part of G.C., said act of youth being contrary to the\n        statutes in such cases made and provided and against the peace and\n        dignity of the State of Oregon.\u201d\n    4\n      Counts 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 were dismissed by the juvenile court at the time of\njurisdiction.\n\fCite as 339 Or App 134 (2025)                            139\n\nhe engaged in intercourse with his 6-year-old half-sister and\nthat he attempted to forcibly compel his 12-year-old cousin\nto touch his penis. We necessarily presume that the juvenile\ncourt determined that there was a factual basis for those\ncharges when it took youth\u2019s Alford pleas.\n         The juvenile court placed youth on probation for\nfive years with conditions that required him to, among other\nthings, obey all laws, abstain from using or possessing con-\ntrolled substances and alcohol, enter and complete sex-\noffender treatment, and not have contact with minor children.\n         Youth began treatment specifically designed for\njuvenile sexual offenders and he was \u201cpretty solid\u201d in that\nprogram for the first eighteen months. By all accounts,\nyouth was \u201cengaged\u201d in all aspects of his probation, includ-\ning treatment, during that initial time period. But youth\u2019s\nengagement with treatment fell off after he left his grand-\nmother\u2019s home at age 18. He often missed scheduled ther-\napy appointments and meetings with his probation officer.\nYouth submitted to various polygraph examinations, but\nthe results were generally inconclusive, and at one point, he\ntested positive for marijuana and methamphetamine. Youth\ndid not complete sex offender treatment. Consequently, the\ncourt found youth to be in violation of probation. It revoked\nhis probation, sanctioned him with \u201ctime served,\u201d and effec-\ntively ended his period of supervision.\n        Youth sought relief from reporting as a sex offender\npursuant to ORS 163A.030. The hearing began before\none judge in June 2022, but it was discontinued and reset\nto begin before a second judge who conducted the hear-\ning over the course of several days beginning in October\n2022 and concluding in January 2023. Witnesses included\nyouth, Dr. Crossen (licensed psychologist who completed an\nupdated psychosexual evaluation concerning youth), Sean\nClark (youth\u2019s therapist), and Rebecca Newmann (youth\u2019s\nprobation officer).\n        Youth testified that he did not complete treatment,\nand he acknowledged that his failure to complete treatment\nresulted in the revocation of his probation. He testified that\nhe had been given a chance to \u201cre-enroll in [treatment]\n\f140                                             State v. B. J. P.\n\nservices\u201d but that he opted not to do so. Youth identified a\nset of photographs that he took of treatment workbook pages\nthat he kept in a binder. He testified that the handwriting\non those pages included that of his therapist, Clark, his\nprobation officer, Newmann, his dad, and his own \u201cchicken\nscratch.\u201d Clark or Newmann would initial the pages as\nyouth completed the work. He testified that the treatment\nchecklist at the back of the binder contained initials on all\nbut the three items that he did not complete: \u201ccomplete all of\nthe assignments,\u201d \u201ccomplete victim awareness assignment,\u201d\nand \u201ccomplete clarification/apology letter.\u201d Youth testified\nthat he did not write any letters to the victims. In partic-\nular, he testified that because he gave Alford pleas on two\nof the counts, a letter of apology or clarification would not\n\u201chave fit [his] specific needs.\u201d He also did not send a letter to\nthe victim in the count that he admitted.\n        Dr. Crossen testified that she completed youth\u2019s\n\u201cupdated psychosexual evaluation.\u201d Her report was received\nin evidence. The 30-page report details Crossen\u2019s findings\nand conclusions, and she testified about those findings at\nthe hearing. In particular, Crossen concluded,\n   \u201cOverall, [youth\u2019s] current estimate of sex offense recidi-\n   vism is low, and therefore the public would not be offered\n   any additional protection by requiring [youth] to register\n   as a sex offender.\u201d\nCrossen offered her opinion that although youth did not com-\nplete his treatment program, he \u201chas a low need for interven-\ntions at this time.\u201d Indeed, Crossen testified that the sexual\nrecidivism rate for juveniles is very low and that \u201cthe risk\nof re-offending is within the first three years after getting\ncaught.\u201d Crossen testified that various studies address juve-\nnile sexual recidivism rates, and that the Caldwell article\nin particular places that rate at 2.75 percent. Youth rested\nafter Crossen\u2019s testimony, and the hearing was continued to\na date approximately one month later.\n         When the hearing continued the next month, youth\noffered the Caldwell article into evidence. The state objected\nbecause youth had rested the month before and had not\ngiven it a copy of the article until the morning it was offered,\n\fCite as 339 Or App 134 (2025)                                    141\n\njust as the state was about to present its evidence. The court\nruled as follows:\n       \u201cIt gets more awkward when we go into these non\u2014\n   these hearings without evidentiary rules, though, when the\n   evidence code doesn\u2019t apply, it\u2019s harder\u2014it\u2019s harder because\n   most of this stuff needs to come in. But I really don\u2019t want\n   to come back in 2025 and still be litigating this case, so the\n   study itself is not going to come in except for purposes of an\n   offer of proof, if we can keep the testimony about what this\n   study says to ten to fifteen minutes, I will allow it. However,\n   beyond\u2014and I\u2019m allowing it in part because I don\u2019t know\n   that it\u2019s going to make a huge difference to the outcome of\n   this case. Beyond that, though, [youth\u2019s counsel], if this is\n   going to be, you know, an hour worth of testimony on this\n   new issue, I don\u2019t think I can go there because I really don\u2019t\n   want to be still here in three years.\u201d\n         The state then called its witnesses, Clark and\nNewmann. Newmann testified that, other than the conduct\nto which youth admitted at the time of jurisdiction, she was\n\u201caware of no hands-on sexual offenses by [youth].\u201d She fur-\nther testified that youth struggled with the \u201caccountability\u201d\npart of the treatment program, at least in part, because\nhe had not admitted to the underlying conduct. Clark and\nNewmann both confirmed that youth had not completed\ntreatment and that, because of that, his probation had been\nrevoked.\n        The parties agree that the purpose of the hearing\nin question was to determine whether youth, who had been\nadjudicated for felony sex crimes as a juvenile offender,\nwould be required to report as a sex offender under ORS\n163A.030. ORS 163A.030(1) provides, as pertinent:\n   \u201c[T]he juvenile court shall hold a hearing on the issue of\n   reporting as a sex offender by a person who has been found\n   to be within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court under ORS\n   419C.005 * * * for having committed an act that if commit-\n   ted by an adult would constitute a felony sex crime[.]\u201d\nThe statute describes the various procedural and eviden-\ntiary requirements for such hearings and, in particular,\nORS 163A.030(7)(b) describes the burden of proof as follows:\n\f142                                                State v. B. J. P.\n\n      \u201cThe person who is the subject of the hearing has the\n   burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that\n   the person is rehabilitated and does not pose a threat to the\n   safety of the public. If the court finds that the person has\n   not met the burden of proof, the court shall enter an order\n   requiring the person to report as a sex offender under ORS\n   163A.025.\u201d\nAs the Supreme Court explained,\n   \u201cwhether a youth must report as a sex offender under ORS\n   163A.030 depends on a factual inquiry. The youth bears\n   the burden to prove that it is highly probable that they\n   have undergone a process of rehabilitation and do not pres-\n   ent a risk of committing future sex offenses. * * * [T]he juve-\n   nile court may order the youth to report as a sex offender\n   only when it finds that those asserted facts are not highly\n   probable.\u201d\nA. R. H., 371 Or at 95. \u201c[A] youth\u2019s pre-adjudication conduct\nalone will not necessarily permit a finding that the youth\nhas failed to prove * * * that the youth is rehabilitated and\nnot a threat to the safety of the public.\u201d Id. at 88.\n       ORS 163A.030(9) establishes relevance as the\nstandard for admitting evidence in hearings to determine\nwhether a youth must report as a sex offender:\n   \u201c* * * [T]he juvenile court may receive testimony, reports\n   and other evidence, without regard to whether the evidence\n   is admissible under [OEC 100] to [OEC 412] and [OEC 601]\n   to [OEC 1008], if the evidence is relevant evidence related\n   to the determination and findings required under this sec-\n   tion. As used in this subsection, \u2018relevant evidence\u2019 has the\n   meaning given that term in [OEC 401].\u201d\nThat relatively low evidentiary bar is consistent with the\nprocedural flexibility built into delinquency hearings, and\nthe well-settled principles that juvenile proceedings are not\ncriminal trials, State v. R. J. S., 318 Or App 351, 354, 506\nP3d 1151, rev den, 370 Or 211 (2022), and delinquency adju-\ndications are not criminal convictions, ORS 419C.400(5).\nImportantly, though, ORS 163A.030(9) describes what the\njuvenile court \u201cmay\u201d receive; it does not describe what must\nbe received.\n\fCite as 339 Or App 134 (2025)                             143\n\n         As an initial matter, to the extent that youth argues\non appeal that he had no discovery obligation to disclose the\nexhibits at issue before the start of the hearing, that argu-\nment is not preserved, and it is not plain or obvious that it\nis correct. We assume, for current purposes, that a hear-\ning under ORS 163A.030 to determine whether an adjudi-\ncated youth must report as a sex offender is a stage in a\nproceeding within the juvenile court\u2019s exclusive delinquency\njurisdiction under ORS 419C.005. That means that ORS\n419C.270 applies to the proceeding except to the extent the\nspecific provisions of ORS 163A.030 indicate otherwise. And\nwhile ORS 163A.030(9) makes many of the provisions of the\nOregon Evidence Code inapplicable to those hearings, cer-\ntain criminal procedures nevertheless apply in delinquency\nproceedings, and ORS 163A.030 does not speak to the issue\nof discovery but ORS 419C.270 does. Among other things,\nORS 419C.270(6) applies ORS 135.835, ORS 135.845, and\nORS 135.865 to delinquency proceedings.\n         ORS 135.835(3) requires the defendant to \u201cdisclose\nto\u201d the prosecuting attorney \u201c[a]ny books, papers, docu-\nments, photographs or tangible objects that the defense\nintends to offer in evidence at the trial\u201d that are \u201cwithin the\npossession or control of the defense.\u201d ORS 135.845 makes\nthose obligations of disclosure time sensitive, requiring that\ndisclosure occur \u201cas soon as practicable following the filing\u201d\nof the charging instrument, and subjecting the parties to\nongoing duties of disclosure for additional materials that\n\u201ca party finds, either before or during trial[.]\u201d ORS 135.865\nprovides the trial court with sanctions that it may impose\nfor discovery violations including ordering \u201cthe violating\nparty to permit inspection of the material, or grant[ing] a\ncontinuance, or refus[ing] to permit the witness to testify,\nor refus[ing] to receive in evidence the material not dis-\nclosed, or enter[ing] such other order as it considers appro-\npriate.\u201d Thus, because youth did not preserve the issue and\nbecause, as we have explained, it is not obvious that youth\nis correct that no statutory discovery obligations apply in a\nhearing under ORS 163A.030, we assume, without decid-\ning, that ORS 419C.270(6), which governs discovery obliga-\ntions in delinquency cases, applies to hearings under ORS\n163A.030, which does not address discovery obligations,\n\f144                                                          State v. B. J. P.\n\nbecause doing so allows us to give effect to both statutes.5\nSee Powers v. Quigley, 345 Or 432, 438, 198 P3d 919 (2008)\n(\u201c[I]f the court can give full effect to both statutes, it will do\nso, and if not, it will treat the specific statute as an exception\nto the general.\u201d).\n         Youth argues that the Caldwell article, Exhibit\n110, was relevant to the key issues of his rehabilitation\nand whether he poses a threat to the safety of the public.\n\u201cThe crux\u201d of the Caldwell article, according to youth, was\nthat it identified the rate of sexual recidivism in individu-\nals like youth. The article is clearly relevant, but the state\ndoes not dispute that, and the juvenile court did not exclude\nthe Caldwell article on relevance grounds. It ultimately\nexcluded the article after this discussion with counsel:\n        \u201c[PROSECUTOR]: So, Your Honor, this was just pro-\n    vided to me this morning, the testimony was last month, I\n    haven\u2019t had a chance to read it, Dr. Crossen testified about\n    it, given that it\u2019s essentially late discovery, there was tes-\n    timony from the Defense expert in relation to that, I would\n    object to just the study being entered into the record due to\n    the discovery I guess late violation as well as Dr. Crossen\u2019s\n    already testified to what she wanted in relation to that and\n    the State would not have time to prepare or to look at any\n    contradicting studies or be able to have a conversation with\n    anybody related to that study.\n        \u201cTHE COURT: [Counsel for youth]?\n       \u201c[YOUTH\u2019S COUNSEL]:           * * * [C]ounsel[ ] had the\n    opportunity to cross-examine Dr. Crossen, also this study\n    she referred to * * * has to do with the very decision that\n    Your Honor is making, which is the recidivism rate gen-\n    erally and then the fact that my client fits within that\n    category of adolescents, so I would think that under the\n\n    5\n      We acknowledge that ORS 135.835 and ORS 135.845 refer to \u201cthe fil-\ning of an indictment or information,\u201d \u201cthe defense,\u201d and \u201cthe trial.\u201d But ORS\n419C.270(6) makes those provisions applicable to delinquency proceedings under\nORS 419C.005, and given that, we assume that those terms must be read to make\nsense in that context as references, respectively, to delinquency petitions, youth,\nand fact-finding hearings. We likewise read those provisions to make sense in\nthe context of delinquency hearings under ORS 163A.030 as references to peti-\ntions for relief from reporting requirements, youth, and the fact-finding hearing\nrequired by ORS 163A.030. As noted, youth did not preserve any argument that\nthere is no statutory discovery process that applies to ORS 163A.030 hearings.\nThat issue is not before us and we do not decide it.\n\fCite as 339 Or App 134 (2025)                                 145\n\n  very loose rule of evidence in a disposition-type hearing in\n  juvenile that anything that would be useful to the Court to\n  have these * * * would certainly fall within that category of\n  relevance.\n     \u201cTHE COURT: I\u2019m going to go ahead and receive the\n  exhibit, but if you want to cross-examine Dr. Crossen addi-\n  tionally, [prosecutor], if you want some additional time\u2014\n      \u201c[PROSECUTOR]: And so Your Honor is essentially\n  saying, hey, you know, we\u2019re\u2014this is day five of this hear-\n  ing, Dr. Crossen at the first hearing testified to that study,\n  it wasn\u2019t provided to the State, so now we\u2019re here on month\n  11, I think, and we\u2019re getting brand new discovery from the\n  Defense, so I can\u2019t possibly make a decision of potentially\n  need[ing] more time when we have victims who have been\n  waiting for this determination as well as I\u2019m sure [youth]\n  as well and we\u2019re getting new stuff from the Defense, which\n  is the State like\u2014\n     \u201cTHE COURT: Why wasn\u2019t it given to [the prosecutor]\n  earlier?\n      \u201c[YOUTH\u2019S COUNSEL]: I just, I asked Dr. Crossen for\n  it because she talked about it repeatedly because I wanted\n  to read it, so I looked at it and I thought it would be use-\n  ful, I just didn\u2019t prepare it for today, so it\u2019s not something\n  that, you know, I thought about other than, as I said, I\u2019m\n  just saying I think it\u2019s highly relevant to the decision Your\n  Honor\u2019s making, it\u2019s just, you know, it is being provided to\n  the Court today, so\u2014\n     \u201c[PROSECUTOR]: And so, Your Honor, that study is\n  referenced in Dr. Crossen\u2019s report from I believe April, so\n  that\u2019s when [youth\u2019s counsel] would have learned of it and\n  would have had the opportunity to do that, we were here in\n  June, we talked about it then, I just, I think it\u2019s manifestly\n  unfair to the State to come in on this\u2014on a bifurcated\n  hearing to have, hey, here\u2019s new information that you pre-\n  viously didn\u2019t have that I\u2019m going to submit as an exhibit\n  without giving you the opportunity to review or be able to\n  address it in any capacity. There I have to feel like there\n  has to be some limit on\u2014\n     \u201cTHE COURT: Yeah, and you\u2019re right\u2014\n     \u201c[PROSECUTOR]: \u2014on when the Defense and just\n  history on this case, Your Honor, when we were in front of\n\f146                                              State v. B. J. P.\n\n   [a different judge], on day two of that hearing the Defense\n   provided the State with what has been admitted as treat-\n   ment notes, so this is something that\u2019s been habitual in\n   this case, I\u2019m afraid if we set this over again the Defense\n   will provide additional exhibits and additional materials\n   every single time we come back\u2014\n      \u201cTHE COURT: The last thing I want to do is set this\n   over again, I will not, I will change my mind on that, I will\n   not receive the exhibit[.]\u201d\nThe parties characterize the trial court\u2019s decision to exclude\nthe Caldwell article as a discovery sanction, but they dis-\nagree about whether it was a proper exercise of the court\u2019s\ndiscretion.\n         We agree that the juvenile court excluded the\nCaldwell article as a discovery violation sanction. As we\nalready explained, youth had an obligation to disclose any\ntangible exhibits that he planned to offer at the hearing,\nand that obligation was ongoing as to \u201cadditional material\nor information\u201d that he became aware of as the hearing pro-\nceeded. The obligation is time-sensitive, requiring prompt\nnotice of any new material. The disclosure obligation is trig-\ngered when a party can \u201creasonably predict\u201d that he will\nintroduce the evidence. See State v. Young, 94 Or App 683,\n689, 767 P2d 90 (1989).\n          Youth is correct that, under OEC 705, an expert may\ntestify to their opinion \u201cand give reasons therefor without\nprior disclosure of the underlying facts or data.\u201d However,\nand as happened here, \u201c[t]he expert may in any event be\nrequired to disclose the underlying facts or data on cross-\nexamination.\u201d OEC 705. Once youth became aware of the\nCaldwell article through Crossen\u2019s testimony and decided to\noffer it as an exhibit, he had a duty to promptly notify the\nstate of his intent to do so. Given that youth had finished\npresenting his case-in-chief and had rested without offering\nthe Caldwell article into evidence, it was not error for the\njuvenile court to conclude that he violated his ongoing dis-\ncovery obligation by not notifying the state that he intended\nto offer the article as an exhibit. Indeed, youth waited for\nthe state to begin presenting its evidence, a month later,\nand then offered the exhibit with no notice at all.\n\fCite as 339 Or App 134 (2025)                              147\n\n         The sanctions available to the juvenile court under\nORS 135.865 ranged from granting a continuance to exclud-\ning the Caldwell article. It is apparent that the court consid-\nered a continuance but determined that exclusion was more\nappropriate under the circumstances. We cannot say that\nthe court abused its discretion, especially given the length\nof time that had passed since youth filed his petition, and\nCrossen\u2019s extensive testimony about the Caldwell article.\n         Youth offered the Kettrey article, Exhibit 112, which\naddresses whether individuals like youth must complete\ntreatment to \u201cfall into the low recidivism category,\u201d during\nhis rebuttal case when he recalled Crossen. Again, the state\ndoes not dispute the relevance of the Kettrey article. After\nhearing from the parties, the juvenile court stated that if it\nwere to \u201ccontinue to receive new exhibits every single [day]\n* * * we will never get this hearing * * * done.\u201d The court\nlater clarified that it would allow Crossen to testify about\nwhether completing a treatment program impacts recidi-\nvism, but that the Kettrey article itself would be excluded.\nWe conclude that the juvenile court did not abuse its discre-\ntion in excluding the Kettrey article for the same reasons it\ndid not abuse its discretion in excluding the Caldwell article.\n         Youth offered a binder of the original workbook\npages from his sex offender treatment program as Exhibit\n111 when he presented his rebuttal case. But youth had,\nin his case-in-chief, already successfully offered Exhibit\n109, which consisted of photographs that he testified he\nhad taken of the pages in his treatment workbook that\nhe had kept in a binder. When questioned about Exhibit\n109 on cross-examination, youth testified that he thought\nExhibit 109 was a complete copy of his notebook but, when\npressed about that, he indicated that he was not certain. His\ntherapist, Clark, later testified that a treatment checklist\nincluded in youth\u2019s Exhibit 109 looked \u201codd\u201d to him because,\namong other reasons, it was \u201cpretty much completely signed\noff\u201d even though he would not typically sign off on such a list\nuntil the end of treatment, which youth did not complete.\n         Youth offered Exhibit 111 to rebut the suggestion\nthat he had \u201cforged\u201d the treatment checklist. In particu-\nlar, he offered Exhibit 111 as \u201crelevant for Your Honor to\n\f148                                              State v. B. J. P.\n\nsee some other original initialings also in the notebook\ndone by Mr. Clark.\u201d The primary focus of the state\u2019s cross-\nexamination of youth about Exhibit 109 was on the check-\nlist. The juvenile court separated the original checklist from\nthe proffered exhibit and received it as Exhibit 113, ruling:\n   \u201cI am going to receive the original of the treatment check-\n   list, I\u2019m not going to receive the originals of anything else\n   * * * that\u2019s duplicative.\u201d\nThe juvenile court, as trier of fact, heard the testimony of\nyouth and Clark concerning the treatment binder, and it\nhad received Exhibits 109 and 113, showing photographs\nof the workbook and the original treatment checklist.\nTherefore, the juvenile court received the original checklist\nthat was at issue during youth\u2019s cross-examination, permit-\nting it to assess the document\u2019s authenticity, and it other-\nwise excluded the portions of the notebook that were dupli-\ncative of the photographs provided in Exhibit 109. Even if,\nfor the purpose of argument only, it was error for the court\nto exclude the rest of Exhibit 111, the evidence excluded was\n\u201cmerely cumulative of admitted evidence\u201d and therefore, its\nexclusion was harmless. State v. Jasperse, 310 Or App 703,\n711, 487 P3d 402, rev den, 368 Or 787 (2021) (internal quo-\ntation marks omitted).\n        Turning, finally, to the juvenile court\u2019s conclusion\nthat youth failed to meet his burden under ORS 163A.030\nand that he must, therefore, report as a sex offender, the\ncourt explained its ruling from the bench as follows:\n       \u201cOn this record, the alleged acts, two of the counts of\n   which he took Alford pleas, one of the counts which he\n   admitted, they\u2019re fairly serious alleged offenses, we have\n   multiple victims, two of whom have significant age gap, at\n   least at the time, between themselves and [youth]. And on\n   this record I feel like I have more questions than answers.\n   I have questions about the youth\u2019s credibility, I have ques-\n   tions about what really happened to the victims, I have\n   questions about why the youth didn\u2019t complete treatment, I\n   have questions about why the youth didn\u2019t at least complete\n   the empathy assignments, the clarification assignments as\n   to the victim that he admitted, I have questions about why\n   the youth seems to minimize what happened even to the\n   victim that he acknowledges, I have questions about why\n\fCite as 339 Or App 134 (2025)                               149\n\n   the youth wasn\u2019t able to better articulate things that he\n   learned in treatment.\n      \u201cI think given those questions and I think given the\n   static factors, I think as [youth\u2019s counsel] has typically\n   described them in other cases, it does pain me, but I find\n   that the youth has not proven by clear and convincing evi-\n   dence that he is rehabilitated and does not pose a safety\n   threat to the public[.]\u201d\nIn its written order, the juvenile court found that \u201cyouth\nhas not proven, by clear and convincing evidence, that he or\nshe is rehabilitated and does not pose a safety threat to the\npublic.\u201d\n         We acknowledge that, when making its oral ruling,\nthe court stated its findings in terms of \u201cquestions\u201d that it\nhad about the nature of the underlying juvenile offenses,\nyouth\u2019s present day credibility, why youth continued to min-\nimize the effect of his offenses on the victims, why he did not\ncomplete treatment\u2014in particular his failure to complete\nthe empathy and clarification assignments\u2014and why youth\ncould not articulate what he had learned in treatment. By\nnoting the many questions it had at the conclusion of the\nhearing, we understand the juvenile court to have been\nexplaining the weaknesses it found in youth\u2019s case and con-\nnecting those weaknesses to youth\u2019s current risk of sexual\nrecidivism. In its explanation, the court relied on risk factors\nthat included youth\u2019s recent failure to complete treatment,\nwhich included, in part, his ongoing refusal to work with the\nvictims vis-\u00e0-vis clarification and empathy assignments. The\nfact that youth entered Alford pleas to two of the charged\noffenses does not explain or excuse his present-day refusal\nto complete treatment, and it did not require the juvenile\ncourt to ignore his treatment deficiencies. First, youth failed\nto complete the clarification and empathy assignments even\nwith respect to the victim of the offense to which he offered\nhis outright admission. And second, youth\u2019s decision not to\ncontest two of the charges and to necessarily accept being\nadjudicated on those charges does not explain his refusal to\ncomplete treatment, his resulting violation of probation, or\nhis decision to opt out of treatment even when it was again\noffered to him. Also, the juvenile court was free to accept or\nreject the expert testimony it heard about sexual recidivism\n\f150                                          State v. B. J. P.\n\nrates and treatment. See Kotler and Winnett, 282 Or App\n584, 598, 385 P3d 1200 (2016) (explaining that a witness\u2019s\n\u201ctestimony was not entitled to greater weight simply because\n[the witness] is an expert; as with all conflicting evidence,\nthe probative value of such evidence is solely for the trial\ncourt to determine\u201d). Given all that, we cannot say that the\nrecord compelled the court to conclude other than it did.\n        Affirmed.\n\f",

J.\n         Youth appeals a juvenile court order denying his\npetition to dismiss jurisdiction. In his petition, youth sought\npost-adjudication relief, under both the state and federal con-\nstitutions, on a claim under ORS 419C.615(1)(a)1 that his trial\ncounsel was constitutionally inadequate and ineffective in fail-\ning to move to suppress statements that youth made to police,\nand that, had those statements been suppressed, he would\nnot have admitted to conduct that, if committed by an adult,\nwould constitute one count of second-degree sexual abuse, ORS\n163.425, and one count of strangulation, ORS 163.187.\n         On appeal, youth raises one assignment of error,\nin which he contends that the juvenile court erred in deny-\ning his petition to dismiss jurisdiction, as trial counsel was\ninadequate and ineffective in failing to file a motion to sup-\npress youth\u2019s statements to police. Accepting the juvenile\ncourt\u2019s supported implicit and explicit factual findings and\nreviewing for legal error, State v. C. L. E., 316 Or App 5, 6,\n502 P3d 1154 (2021), we affirm.\n         In evaluating whether youth was entitled to post-\nadjudication relief under ORS 419C.615(1)(a), \u201cwe apply\nthe constitutional standards for inadequate and ineffec-\ntive assistance of counsel that have been developed at the\nstate and federal level in the context of post-conviction and\nhabeas corpus relief.\u201d State v. J. J.-M., 282 Or App 459, 463,\n387 P3d 426 (2016). To prevail on a claim of inadequate and\nineffective assistance of counsel under those constitutional\nstandards, youth must have proved both a performance and\na prejudice prong. Id. at 464; see also Johnson v. Premo, 315\nOr App 1, 8, 499 P3d 814 (2021) (stating the \u201cfunctionally\nequivalent\u201d standards for inadequate and ineffective assis-\ntance of counsel under the state and federal constitutions).\n     1\n       ORS 419C.615 provides, as relevant:\n          \u201c(1) In addition to any other grounds upon which a person may petition\n     a court under ORS 419C.610, a person may petition the court on the following\n     grounds to set aside an order finding the person to be within the jurisdiction\n     of the court under ORS 419C.005:\n          \u201c(a) A substantial denial in the proceedings resulting in the person\u2019s\n     adjudication, or in the appellate review of the adjudication, of the person\u2019s\n     rights under the United States Constitution or the Oregon Constitution, or\n     both, and the denial rendered the adjudication void[.]\u201d\n\fCite as 339 Or App 35 (2025)                                 37\n\n         Youth argues that the juvenile court erred when it\ndenied youth relief on his claim of inadequate and ineffec-\ntive assistance of counsel. As youth sees it, his trial coun-\nsel\u2019s performance was deficient because youth \u201chad a meri-\ntorious argument that his statements [to police] should have\nbeen suppressed\u201d but trial counsel \u201cdid not see a suppression\nissue.\u201d The state responds that \u201cyouth failed to prove that\nhis attorney performed deficiently by pursuing an early,\nfavorable resolution rather than filing a motion to suppress\u201d\nor that \u201cthe alleged deficient performance resulted in preju-\ndice.\u201d We address each prong\u2014the performance prong and\nthe prejudice prong\u2014in turn.\n          Regarding the performance prong, it was youth\u2019s\nburden to prove that \u201c \u2018counsel\u2019s decision reflects an absence\nof professional skill and judgment, a question that turns on\nthe facts known at the time that counsel made that deci-\nsion.\u2019 \u201d C. L. E., 316 Or App at 10 (quoting Davis v. Kelly, 303\nOr App 253, 262, 461 P3d 1043, rev den, 366 Or 826 (2020)).\n         Applying that standard here, the record reflects\nthat trial counsel\u2019s decision not to pursue suppression of\nyouth\u2019s statements to police did not reflect an absence of\nprofessional skill and judgment. Youth\u2019s trial counsel testi-\nfied at the hearing on the petition to set aside jurisdiction\nthat she had viewed the evidence of the police interrogation\nof youth and opined that it \u201clooked like a revocation of any\ninvoking of his right to remain silent.\u201d That is, suppression\nof youth\u2019s statements was unlikely to be successful, because,\nalthough youth invoked his right to remain silent, he sub-\nsequently spoke to police after receiving Miranda warnings,\nand he was also evaluated by a doctor who concluded that\nthere were no concerns regarding youth\u2019s ability to under-\nstand his Miranda rights. See State v. McAnulty, 356 Or 432,\n458, 338 P3d 653 (2014) (explaining that when a suspect has\ninvoked their right to remain silent, \u201cpolice may reinitiate\ncontact after a reasonable time, provide new Miranda warn-\nings, and obtain a valid waiver\u201d). We do not understand this\nto be a case where youth\u2019s trial counsel simply failed to \u201csee\u201d\na meritorious legal issue, as youth contends.\n         Further, trial counsel\u2019s testimony reflects that other\nfactors in youth\u2019s case bore on trial counsel\u2019s decision not to\n\f38                                           State v. D. W. N.\n\npursue suppression, including that the state would revoke\nits plea offer on the filing of that motion and might charge\nyouth as an adult; that a successful motion would likely lead\nto a trial on the more serious charge of first-degree rape;\nthat the victim was \u201cadamant\u201d about the case going to trial;\nthat the state would still have the victim\u2019s statements as\nevidence even if youth\u2019s statements were suppressed; and\nthat youth would not be able to testify even if his statements\nwere suppressed to avoid \u201copening the door\u201d to admission of\nthose suppressed statements. In addition, an affidavit sub-\nmitted by the prosecutor in youth\u2019s case averred that, had\nthe trial court \u201centertained a suppression of [youth\u2019s state-\nments to police], the [plea] offer would have been immedi-\nately revoked and the state would have proceeded to trial on\nall the allegations in the original petition.\u201d The prosecutor\nfurther averred that, had a motion to suppress been granted,\n\u201cthe state would have absolutely proceeded to trial without\nyouth\u2019s statements[,]\u201d because the remaining evidence, in\nthe prosecutor\u2019s view, \u201cwould have been sufficiently compel-\nling to prove the allegations beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d\n         Thus, we conclude that trial counsel\u2019s decision not to\npursue suppression of youth\u2019s statements was not deficient\nbecause it was a strategic decision and a reasonable exercise\nof professional skill and judgment in response to the circum-\nstances. See, e.g., Gorham v. Thompson, 332 Or 560, 567, 34\nP3d 161 (2001) (explaining that \u201ca reviewing court will not\nsecond-guess a lawyer\u2019s tactical decisions in the name of the\nconstitution unless those decisions reflect an absence or sus-\npension of professional skill and judgment\u201d).\n         But even if that trial counsel\u2019s performance was\ndeficient, we conclude that there was no prejudice. Under\nthe prejudice prong, we \u201cfocus[ ] on whether trial counsel\u2019s\nconstitutionally inadequate performance affected the out-\ncome of the plea process\u201d in cases such as this one \u201cwhere\nthe adjudication is based on a plea.\u201d C. L. E., 316 Or App at\n16. To establish prejudice, youth was required to \u201cshow that\nbut for the inadequate and ineffective assistance, he would\nhave pleaded differently.\u201d Id.\n         The evidence that youth offered to prove prejudice\nis his written declaration in which he attests that, had trial\n\fCite as 339 Or App 35 (2025)                                                     39\n\ncounsel moved to suppress his statements, he \u201cwould not\nhave accepted the plea agreement\u201d and \u201cwould not have\nentered admissions[.]\u201d However, the juvenile court was per-\nmitted to make a determination that youth was not credible.\nConsequently, we conclude that youth did not prove that he\nwas prejudiced by trial counsel\u2019s failure to move to suppress\nhis statements.2\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n       The juvenile court did not explain its reason for denying youth\u2019s petition;\nthat is, it did not indicate whether the denial was based on a determination that\nyouth had failed to meet the performance prong of his claim, the prejudice prong\nof his claim, or both.\n     Youth contends that \u201cbecause the trial court could have denied relief without\nreaching the issue of prejudice, this court should reverse and remand for the\ncourt to consider youth\u2019s evidence [regarding prejudice] in the first instance.\u201d\n     For this court to perform its review function, it is helpful when a lower court\nexplains the basis for its ruling. As the Supreme Court stated in Datt v. Hill,\n347 Or 672, 684, 227 P3d 714 (2010), \u201c[i]t is a truism, and an important one,\nthat a post-conviction trial court can be of great assistance to appellate courts\nby making findings of historical facts and explaining how its conclusions derive\nfrom those findings.\u201d That is, \u201c[a]n understanding of how a post-conviction trial\ncourt actually, rather than presumptively, arrived at its decision enhances the\neffectiveness of appellate review.\u201d Id. at 685; see also Pereida-Alba v. Coursey, 356\nOr 654, 670-71, 342 P3d 70 (2015) (noting that \u201cwe presume that a trial court\nimplicitly resolves factual disputes consistently with its ultimate conclusion\u201d but\nthat \u201c[i]f an implicit factual finding is not necessary to a trial court\u2019s ultimate\nconclusion * * *, then the presumption does not apply\u201d). We think the important\n\u201ctruism\u201d that the Supreme Court observed in Datt applies equally to a claim\nfor post-adjudication relief under ORS 419C.615(1)(a)\u2014the kind of claim at issue\nin this appeal\u2014as it does to a claim seeking relief under the Post-Conviction\nHearings Act\u2014the kind of claim at issue in Datt.\n     In any event, for purposes of our analysis, we have assumed that the juvenile\ncourt denied youth\u2019s motion on either the performance prong, the prejudice prong,\nor both; and, as set forth above, the record was sufficient for the juvenile court\nto have denied youth\u2019s motion on either (or both) of those bases. Remand for the\njuvenile court to address the prejudice prong in the first instance is unnecessary.\nCf. Dickerson v. Fhuere, 316 Or App 62, 67, 501 P3d 1072 (2021) (reversing and\nremanding \u201cbecause the post-conviction court\u2019s decision was based on an error\nof law and, as a result of that error, the court never made the factual determina-\ntions necessary to allow for resolution of petitioner\u2019s claim under the correct legal\nstandard\u201d).\n\f",

In addition, an affidavit sub-\nmitted by the prosecutor in youth\u2019s case averred that, had\nthe trial court \u201centertained a suppression of [youth\u2019s state-\nments to police], the [plea] offer would have been immedi-\nately revoked and the state would have proceeded to trial on\nall the allegations in the original petition.\u201d The prosecutor\nfurther averred that, had a motion to suppress been granted,\n\u201cthe state would have absolutely proceeded to trial without\nyouth\u2019s statements[,]\u201d because the remaining evidence, in\nthe prosecutor\u2019s view, \u201cwould have been sufficiently compel-\nling to prove the allegations beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d\n         Thus, we conclude that trial counsel\u2019s decision not to\npursue suppression of youth\u2019s statements was not deficient\nbecause it was a strategic decision and a reasonable exercise\nof professional skill and judgment in response to the circum-\nstances.

As we explain below, defendant did not do so\nand we, therefore, reject his first assignment as unpreserved.\n         The trial court, on defendant\u2019s request, severed the\nvarious charges into two trials: one for charges connected to\na pair of coffee shop robberies, and one for charges related to\nburglaries at a credit union and a Fred Meyer store.

BRYANT DONALDSON, JR.\n\n                 Appeal from the Criminal Court for Wilson County\n                     No. 20-CR-119     Brody N.

After a sentencing hearing, the trial court\nimposed an effective twenty-three-year sentence. Defendant appeals, arguing that the trial\ncourt erred in admitting his psychosexual evaluation and a victim impact statement at\nsentencing and that the trial court misapplied enhancement factors. Upon our review of\nthe entire record, the briefs of the parties, and the applicable law, we affirm the judgments\nof the trial court.\n\n Tenn. R. App. P. 3 Appeal as of Right; Judgments of the Criminal Court Affirmed\n\nJILL BARTEE AYERS, J., delivered the opinion of the court, in which ROBERT L.\nHOLLOWAY, JR., and ROBERT H. MONTGOMERY, JR., JJ., joined.\n\nDaniel J. Turklay, Lebanon, Tennessee, for the appellant, Bryant Donaldson, Jr.\n\nJonathan Skrmetti, Attorney General and Reporter; Ryan Dugan, Assistant Attorney\nGeneral; Jason Lawson, District Attorney General; and Thomas Harwell Swink, Assistant\nDistrict Attorney General, for the appellee, State of Tennessee.\n\n                                        OPINION\n\n                          Factual and Procedural Background\n\n       On February 12, 2020, Defendant was indicted for one count of especially\naggravated sexual exploitation of a minor (count one), six counts of statutory rape by an\nauthority figure (counts two through seven), and six counts of aggravated statutory rape\n(counts eight through thirteen). The case proceeded to trial on July 27, 2021. After the\nState completed voir dire, a plea agreement was reached. Pursuant to the plea agreement,\n\fDefendant pled guilty to counts one and eight through thirteen in exchange for the dismissal\nof counts two through seven. The trial court would determine the length and manner of\nsentence. We note that the appellate record does not contain a transcript of trial\nproceedings or of Defendant\u2019s plea submission. See State v. Keen, 996 S.W.2d 842, 843-\n44 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1999) (\u201c[A] transcript of the guilty plea hearing is often (if not\nalways) needed in order to conduct a proper review of the sentence imposed.\u201d); Tenn. R.\nApp. P. 24(b) (stating that the appellant has the duty to prepare a record which conveys a\n\u201cfair, accurate and complete account of what transpired with respect to those issues that are\nthe bases of appeal\u201d). An appellate who fails to include the transcript of the guilty plea\nhearing in the record risks waiver of a sentencing issue. This court determines on a case-\nby-case basis whether the record is sufficient for meaningful review without the inclusion\nof the plea submission transcript. State v. Caudle, 388 S.W.3d 273, 279 (Tenn. 2012). In\nthis case, we will consider the merits of Defendant\u2019s sentencing issues because the facts of\nthe offense are sufficiently stated in the presentence report. The relevant facts underlying\nthe plea, as provided in the presentence report, are as follows:\n\n       On January 11, 2020, . . . officers with the Wilson County Sheriff\u2019s\n       Department were dispatched to [the victim\u2019s house regarding] a possible\n       rape. Detectives arrived at the residence, where the 14[-]year[-]old female\n       victim . . . resided with her mother and others, including the victim\u2019s 15[-\n       ]year[-]old sister and [Defendant]. Upon arrival detectives made contact\n       with the victim\u2019s mother, who[] advised that she had checked [the victim\u2019s]\n       phone and found a picture of a penis and a video of [the victim] in a sexual\n       act with [Defendant]. She advised that she recognized the location that the\n       video was taken as in the laundry room . . . . The phone was placed into\n       evidence and the laundry room photographed. At this time the victim was\n       being taken to [S]ummit [H]ospital by her grandmother. Detectives then\n       received a call from Summit Hospital Emergency Room nurse stating that\n       the victim was being transported to Our Kids (Nashville General Hospital)\n       to have a sexual assault kit conducted. After leaving [the victim\u2019s house],\n       deputies transported [Defendant] to the Sheriff\u2019s Department to be\n       interviewed. Detectives met with [Defendant] at the Sheriff\u2019s [D]epartment\n       and upon being advised of his rights[, Defendant] agreed to speak with\n       detectives. [Defendant] was asked about his relationship with the victim and\n       [Defendant] stated that \u201cshe looks up to him\u201d and that they just sit around\n       and talk. [Defendant] was then asked if he had had any sexual contact with\n       the victim and he denied having any sexual relationship with her. Detectives\n       explained the video evidence they ha[d] in which showed [Defendant] and\n       the victim engaging in a sexual act. [Defendant] denied a sexual act and\n       argued that detectives did not have a video of him. He stated that he has only\n       had a parenting[,] role model type relationship with the victim. Upon being\n                                            -2-\n\fasked if he had taken any type of drugs, [Defendant] stated that he takes drugs\non a daily basis and had used earlier the same day but would not elaborate\non what drugs he had taken. It was determined that the subject was under\nthe influence at that time and the interview was stopped. . . .\n\nOn January 13, 2020[,] the victim\u2019s mother stated to detectives that she had\njust found out that her other daughter (K.R.) had also been approached by\n[D]efendant in a sexual manner. A forensic interview was then conducted\nwith the victim at the child advocacy center on the date of January 13, 2020.\nDuring this interview the victim reported that she understood that she is here\nto talk about Bryant \u201cbubba\u201d Donaldson and what happened. She stated that\n[Defendant] is Sierra\u2019s brother (Sierra lives with them). She reported that\nthe incidents started around August of 2019 in which she and [Defendant]\nbegan talking as friends and about a month after things progressed. She\nstated that he would tell her that he loved her, wanted to marry her and have\nkids with her. She stated that a few days prior to the interview they had sex.\nShe stated that her mother went through her phone and found pictures and\nvideo of her and [Defendant]. She stated that her grandmother then drove\nher to Summit Hospital and then to Our Kids. She stated that the incident on\nSaturday was not the only time they had sex, the first time was around August\nor September 2019. She stated that [Defendant] would touch her body all\nover before they had sex (breasts, legs, vagina). She stated that the first time\nthey had sex was in the basement of her mother\u2019s house on the couch. After\nthey had sex, she stated that [Defendant] would digitally penetrate her\nvagina. She stated that he did not use protection when they had sex. She\nreported that they had sex multiple times. She stated that the first time they\nhad sex it did hurt her for a few seconds but did not hurt later. She stated\nthat on Saturday (January 11, 2020) they had sex with him penetrating her\nvaginally standing behind her with her hands on the wall. She stated that she\nperformed oral sex on [Defendant] twice, all incidents did occur in the\nbasement. She stated that everyone else was usually upstairs in the home\nwhen they had sex. When they had sex he would ejaculate both outside and\ninside of her. She stated that after the first time she told her sister (K.R.).\nLater on January 13, 2020[,] the victim\u2019s sister (K.R.) was interviewed at the\nchild advocacy center, with her mother present. K.R. stated that she has\nknown [Defendant] for approximately [ten] years and they refer to him as\n\u201cbubba.\u201d She reported that [Defendant] had moved in with them in June\n2019 but sometimes stays with his sister Brandy in Gordonsville. She stated\nthat [Defendant] does not have a phone, car or a job and is often at home\nwhen everyone else is gone. Upon being asked about the sleeping\narrangements of the household[,] K.R. states that he often slept in her\n                                     -3-\n\f      mother\u2019s room or downstairs in the basement. She stated that everyone else\n      slept in bedrooms on the main floor of the house. She was then asked about\n      the sexual incidents between her sister and [Defendant] and she stated that\n      she had not seen the incidents but described an incident in which the three of\n      them were downstairs and she could hear the victim and [Defendant]\n      whispering. Upon asking what they were whispering about[,] [Defendant]\n      told her that they were making a bet that on whether she (K.R.) would have\n      sex with him or with them. She states that she told them that she wouldn\u2019t\n      and they stopped discussing it. She states that [Defendant] told her that he\n      and the victim were \u201cinterrupted\u201d earlier that day and they were going to\n      finish. She then states that [Defendant] and the victim then went into the\n      victim\u2019s room to \u201cfinish.\u201d She states that this occurred about a week and a\n      half ago. She then spoke of another incident in which they were at\n      [Defendant]\u2019s sister\u2019s house in Gordonsville and she was babysitting his\n      sister\u2019s kids. She states that while they were there he typed \u201cwill you have\n      sex with me, I will give you money or something you want\u201d into his phone\n      and showed it to her. She stated that she again refused. She stated that these\n      were the only times he asked her to do it but that he frequently made \u201csly\n      comments\u201d about it to her. She stated that she had asked the victim about\n      her sexual relationship with [Defendant] and she states that the victim told\n      her that she (the victim) and [Defendant] had had sex \u201ctoo many times to\n      count.\u201d Interviewer then spoke to K.R. about the difficulties of this type of\n      interview and the importance for her to be open and honest and that she was\n      not in any kind of trouble. K.R. then stated that in that case, there was another\n      incident in which one day [Defendant] had yelled at her to come into the\n      laundry room that he had something to tell her and when she went in he began\n      kissing her and he put his hand down her pants and she told him to stop. On\n      May 25, 2020[,] the [Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (\u201cTBI\u201d)] crime lab\n      issued a report indicating their analysis of the sexual assault kit and report\n      revealed the . . . sperm found on the victim\u2019s labia and vaginal swabs were a\n      DNA match to [Defendant].\n\n       On March 21, 2022, the trial court conducted a sentencing hearing. Defendant\u2019s\npresentence report, which included the victim\u2019s mother\u2019s victim impact statement, was\nadmitted into evidence. As noted in the presentence report, Defendant reported that he\n\u201cwas out of [his] mind\u201d when the victim \u201capproached [him] and [he] allowed it to happen.\u201d\nThe report also showed a confirmed gang affiliation and Defendant\u2019s criminal history\nwhich included convictions for aggravated robbery and failure to appear. Regarding his\naggravated robbery conviction, Defendant was sentenced to eight years suspended to\nprobation; following two violations, his probation was revoked. Defendant reported his\nmental health as \u201cpoor\u201d and admitted to alcohol and drug problems. He first drank alcohol\n                                            -4-\n\fat age thirteen, used heroin from 2018 until his arrest in 2020, and used methamphetamine\nand marijuana from \u201c2007 / 2008 until his arrest in 2020.\u201d Defendant reported that his\ndrug and alcohol use contributed to his current charges. Defendant\u2019s Strong-R Risk and\nNeeds Assessment resulted in risk score of \u201chigh.\u201d\n\n       The State then read the victim\u2019s mother\u2019s victim impact statement into the record.\nIn the statement, the victim\u2019s mother expressed that Defendant had \u201ctaken [her] child\u2019s\ninnocence away\u201d and caused the victim to be \u201cfull of anger and rage and hate.\u201d The\nvictim\u2019s mother questioned whether Defendant had \u201cput together a big master plan to use\n[her] so [he] could get to [her] girls[.]\u201d She expressed her belief that this was not an isolated\nincident and \u201cpray[ed] . . . that no little girl is ever around\u201d Defendant again. The victim\u2019s\nmother requested Defendant receive the maximum sentence.\n\n       Defendant objected to the State\u2019s reading of the victim impact statement,\nacknowledging that the victim has a right to put a statement into the record but requesting\nthat the trial court \u201cnot consider any hearsay that was contained in the statement as\nsubstantive evidence against [Defendant], things that, you know, the child victim might\nhave said, you know, to the mother, specifically.\u201d The court noted the victim impact\nstatement had not been subjected to cross-examination and stated it would \u201cgrant it the\nweight it\u2019s due, based on what [it\u2019s] heard.\u201d\n\n       Defendant\u2019s psychosexual evaluation was also admitted into evidence. Defendant\nnoted that he had \u201cassumed\u201d that the doctor who conducted the evaluation would testify\nbut acknowledged that the report was likely admissible even without the doctor\u2019s\ntestimony. However, \u201cto the extent that [he was] wrong about that and the statute doesn\u2019t\nspecifically allow that in,\u201d Defendant maintained his objection to the admission of the\npsychosexual evaluation without an opportunity to cross-examine the doctor.\n\n       The psychosexual evaluation included information regarding Defendant\u2019s current\nmental status, his family and interpersonal relationships, academic and criminal history,\nand psychiatric and substance abuse history. It also included questionnaires, objective\ntesting, and tools to determine Defendant\u2019s risk to reoffend. According to Defendant\u2019s\nversion of events, the victim \u201cwas the aggressor\u201d and was \u201cthrowing herself\u201d at him until\n\u201ceventually [Defendant] gave in.\u201d Defendant stated that the victim performed oral sex on\nhim, but he denied sexual intercourse. He \u201cdismissed the DNA evidence as [in]valid\u201d and\nasserted the victim and witness statements were incorrect and the victim\u2019s mother \u201cgot\neverybody to go against\u201d him. Ultimately, the evaluating doctor determined that\nDefendant\u2019s risk for engaging in sexual misconduct was \u201cwell above average[.]\u201d\n\n      Brandi Donaldson, Defendant\u2019s sister, testified that she had witnessed the victim\nconsume alcohol, smoke marijuana, and make sexual advances on grown men. Ms.\n                                              -5-\n\fDonaldson stated that Defendant is \u201ca really good person\u201d who had not been given the\nchance he needs and \u201cfalls victim to trying to fit in and do what other people want from\nhim.\u201d Defendant introduced five certificates of completion for behavioral and Bible classes\nhe had obtained while incarcerated.\n\n       The trial court stated that it had considered the evidence at the sentencing hearing,\nthe presentence report, the principles of sentencing and arguments on sentencing\nalternatives, the nature of the criminal conduct, evidence regarding mitigating and\nenhancement factors, statistical information from the administrative office of the courts on\nsentencing and Defendant\u2019s potential for rehabilitation and treatment. It found Defendant\nto be a Range I standard offender and noted that count one was a non-probateable offense\nrequired to be served at 100%. The trial court found that mitigating factor one, that the\ncriminal conduct neither caused nor threatened serious bodily injury, applied but did not\n\u201cput a whole lot of weight on it.\u201d See T.C.A. \u00a7 40-35-113(1).\n\n        Regarding enhancement factors, the trial court \u201cput a great deal of credit\u201d on\nDefendant\u2019s conviction for failure to appear and \u201cextensive, long-term\u201d drug use because\n\u201cthe best predictor of future performances is past behavior[.]\u201d See id. \u00a7 -114(1) (\u201cThe\ndefendant has a previous history of criminal convictions or criminal behavior, in addition\nto those necessary to establish the appropriate range[.]\u201d). It also applied enhancement\nfactor seven, that the crime was committed to gratify Defendant\u2019s desire for pleasure and\nexcitement. See id. \u00a7 -114(7). The court noted that Defendant was in a sexual relationship\nwith the victim\u2019s mother, \u201ca willing sex partner that\u2019s more your age[,]\u201d when he undertook\nthis sexual relationship with \u201cthis child\u201d and ejaculated during the sexual encounter. Based\non Defendant\u2019s two prior probation violations, the trial court found that Defendant had\nfailed to comply with the conditions of a sentence involving release into the community.\nSee id. \u00a7 -114(8). Finally, the trial court found that Defendant violated a position of private\ntrust because Defendant was \u201cinvolved in a parental role for this child\u201d and the victim\u2019s\nmother \u201ctrusted [Defendant] enough to have him in the house\u201d with her children. See id.\n\u00a7 -114(14).\n\n        The trial court sentenced Defendant to eleven years for count one and four years\neach for counts eight through thirteen. After considering the \u201caggravating circumstances,\u201d\nit found that partial consecutive sentencing was appropriate because Defendant was\nconvicted of more than two offenses involving sexual abuse of a minor. See id. \u00a7 40-35-\n115(a)(5). It ordered that counts nine and ten be served consecutively to count one, and\nthat eight, eleven, twelve, and thirteen run concurrently with each other but consecutively\nto counts one, nine, and ten, for an effective sentence of twenty-three years.\n\n       On March 21, 2022, the trial court entered a written order containing its oral\nfindings. Defendant filed a timely motion for new trial on April 20, 2022, which was\n                                             -6-\n\fsubsequently amended on May 8, 2023. The trial court denied Defendant\u2019s motion for new\ntrial via written order on April 4, 2024.1 Defendant\u2019s timely appeal is now before this\ncourt.\n\n                                               Analysis\n\n                                     I. Admission of Evidence\n\n        On appeal, Defendant argues that the psychosexual evaluation and the victim impact\nstatement were inadmissible hearsay, and their admission at the sentencing hearing violated\nhis rights under the confrontation clause because the authors of the documents did not\ntestify. The State argues that the trial court properly admitted the psychosexual evaluation\nand the victim impact statement. We agree with the State.\n\n        Both the United States and Tennessee constitutions provide criminal defendants the\nright to confront witnesses against them. U.S. Const. amend. VI; Tenn. Const. art. I, \u00a7 9.\n\u201cThe admission of testimonial hearsay at trial, without a showing of unavailability and an\nopportunity to cross-examine, generally violates a defendant\u2019s right to confront adverse\nwitnesses.\u201d State v.

Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 50 (2004)).\nHowever, this court has repeatedly held that \u201cthe Confrontation Clause is not applicable to\nsentencing hearings.\u201d State v. Bonds, 502 S.W.3d 118, 150 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2016) (first\nciting State v. Whited, No. E2013-02523-CCA-R3-CD, 2015 WL 2097843, at *10 (Tenn.\nCrim. App. May 4, 2015), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 506 S.W.3d 416 (Tenn. 2016); then\nciting State v. Boyd, No. W2009-00762-CCA-R3-CD, 2010 WL 1240720, at *8 (Tenn.\nCrim.

Watkins, 362 S.W.3d 530 (Tenn. 2012)). Thus, Defendant\u2019s argument that the\nvictim impact statement and the psychosexual evaluation violated his rights under the\nconfrontation clause are unavailing.\n\n        The Tennessee Rules of Evidence apply at sentencing except that reliable hearsay\n\u201cmay be admitted if the opposing party is accorded a fair opportunity to rebut any hearsay\nevidence so admitted[.]\u201d T.C.A. \u00a7 40-35-209(b). Examples of reliable hearsay include\ncertified copies of convictions or documents and presentence reports. State v. Richmond,\nNo. M2021-01025-CCA-R3-CD, 2022 WL 4372220, at *11 (Tenn. Crim. App. Sept. 22,\n2022) (citing State v. Baker, 956 S.W.2d 8, 17 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1997)), no perm. app.\n\n   1\n     The reasons for the approximate one-year delay between the original and amended motion for new trial\nand the trial court\u2019s entry of a written order denying the motion are unclear from the record. However,\nneither party raises the issue on appeal.\n                                                  -7-\n\ffiled; see Jenkins v. State, E2010-00938-CCA-R3-PC, 2011 WL 810770, at *5 (Tenn.\nCrim. App. Mar. 9, 2011) (concluding that the petitioner could not establish prejudice\nstemming from counsel\u2019s failure to object to admission of the presentence report because\n\u201cit is settled law that the presentence report is reliable hearsay and is admissible during\nsentencing hearings\u201d).\n\n       When a defendant is convicted of a sex offense, which includes aggravated statutory\nrape, and is eligible for an alternative sentence, a psychosexual evaluation \u201cshall be\nincluded as part of the presentence report and shall be considered by the court[.]\u201d T.C.A.\n\u00a7 39-13-705(b) (emphasis added). Additionally, \u201c[p]rior to imposition of sentence in a\nfelony case, the department of correction shall prepare a written victim impact statement\nas part of the presentence report on the defendant.\u201d Id. \u00a7 40-38-205. Thus, both the\npsychosexual evaluation and the victim impact statement were part of the presentence\nreport, and the \u201ctrial court is entitled to rely on the presentence report \u2018absent a showing\nthat the report is based upon unreliable sources or is otherwise inaccurate.\u2019\u201d State v.\nRogers, No. W2021-00807-CCA-R3-CD, 2022 WL 2733698, at *9 (Tenn. Crim. App. July\n14, 2022) (quoting State v. Crossman, No. 01C01-9311-CR-00394, 1994 WL 548712, at\n*6 (Tenn. Crim. App. Oct. 6, 1994)), no perm. app. filed. Because the psychosexual\nevaluation and victim impact statement are not constitutionally prohibited and are\nexplicitly authorized by statute, such evidence is admissible so long as it is reliable, and\nDefendant was provided the opportunity to rebut the evidence. See State v. Moss, 13\nS.W.3d 374, 385 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1999); T.C.A. \u00a7 40-35-209(b).\n\n       The victim impact statement was attached to the presentence report. It included\nboth the Tennessee Department of Correction (\u201cTDOC\u201d) Victim Impact Statement form,\nwhich was filled out, signed, and dated by the victim\u2019s mother and a typed statement from\nthe victim\u2019s mother on a separate page. See Harris, 2009 WL 1871919, at *6 (citing State\nv. Garner, No. M1999-01427-CCA-R3-CD, 2000 WL 1681022, at *3 (Tenn. Crim. App.\nNov. 9, 2000)) (stating that a victim impact statement\u2019s inclusion in the presentence report\noperated to verify the hearsay\u2019s reliability). While the typed statement does not include\nthe victim\u2019s mother\u2019s name or signature, it does include the style of the case and the\nvictim\u2019s mother indicated on the TDOC form to \u201csee attached.\u201d Additionally, the\nsubstance of the typed statement makes clear the victim\u2019s mother wrote the statement. To\nthe extent the written statement included details of the circumstances surrounding the\noffenses, such details explained the impact of Defendant\u2019s crimes on the victim and her\nfamily. We conclude that the victim impact statement was sufficiently reliable and, thus,\nwas properly admitted and considered by the trial court.\n\n       Regarding the psychosexual evaluation, Defendant has presented no evidence that\nthe psychosexual evaluation contained inaccuracies or was otherwise unreliable. We note\nthat Defendant asserts in his brief that \u201cthere is nothing in the record authenticating [the\n                                           -8-\n\fpsychosexual evaluation] as actually being the full, final, and complete document[.]\u201d\nHowever, Defendant did not raise this objection at sentencing or in his motion for new\ntrial. Thus, Defendant has waived any objection to the authenticity of the psychosexual\nevaluation. See Tenn. R. App. P. 36(a) (\u201cNothing in this rule shall be construed as requiring\nrelief be granted to a party responsible for an error or who failed to take whatever action\nwas reasonably available to prevent or nullify the harmful effect of an error.\u201d); State v.\nAvila-Salazar, No. M2023-01649-CCA-R3-CD, 2024 WL 3738647, at *2 (Tenn. Crim.\nApp. Aug. 9, 2024) (stating that a party cannot raise an issue for the first time or change\ntheir argument on appeal), perm. app. denied (Tenn. Jan. 24, 2025). The trial court did not\nerr in admitting and considering the psychosexual evaluation because the right to confront\nwitnesses does not extend to sentencing proceedings, and the trial court was required to\nconsider the psychosexual evaluation in sentencing Defendant for counts eight through\nthirteen.\n\n        Defendant is not entitled to relief on this basis.\n\n                                        II. Enhancement Factors\n\n        Defendant argues that the trial court erred by applying enhancement factors seven\nand fourteen because there was no evidence that the offenses were committed to satisfy\nDefendant\u2019s desire for pleasure and excitement other than the inherent sexual nature of\nDefendant\u2019s crimes or that he abused a position of private trust. 2 The State asserts that the\ntrial court properly applied these factors, and in the alternative, any error was harmless\nbecause the trial court imposed a within-range sentence after applying two unchallenged\nenhancement factors. We agree with the State.\n\n       On appeal, the party challenging the sentence bears the burden of establishing that\nthe sentence is improper. State v. Branham, 501 S.W.3d 577, 595 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2016).\nThis court reviews sentencing decisions under an \u201cabuse of discretion standard of review,\ngranting a presumption of reasonableness to within-range sentencing decisions that reflect\na proper application of the purposes and principles of our Sentencing Act.\u201d State v. Bise,\n380 S.W.3d 682, 707 (Tenn. 2012). \u201cA trial court abuses its discretion when it applies\nincorrect legal standards, reaches an illogical conclusion, bases its ruling on a clearly\nerroneous assessment of the proof, or applies reasoning that causes an injustice to the\ncomplaining party.\u201d State v. Phelps, 329 S.W.3d 436, 443 (Tenn. 2010) (citing State v.\nJordan, 325 S.W.3d 1, 38-40 (Tenn. 2010)).\n\n\n   2\n     In his brief, Defendant directs this court\u2019s attention to enhancement factors seven and fourteen but fails\nto include proper citation to the applicable statute or any case law in support of his position. While\nDefendant\u2019s omission has not frustrated this court\u2019s review, we reiterate the importance of including proper\nauthority in support of legal arguments. See Tenn. R. App. P. 27(a)(7)(a); Tenn. Ct. Crim. App. 10(b).\n                                                    -9-\n\f       Once a trial court determines the appropriate range of punishment, the trial court\nmust consider: (1) the evidence received at trial and the sentencing hearing; (2) the\npresentence report, including a validated risk and needs assessment; (3) any arguments as\nto sentencing alternatives; (4) the nature and characteristics of the criminal conduct; (5)\nany applicable mitigating and enhancement factors; (6) any statement the defendant makes\non his behalf; and (7) statistical information provided by the administrative office of the\ncourts as to sentencing practices for similar offenses in Tennessee. T.C.A. \u00a7 40-35-210(a),\n(b). Additionally, the sentence imposed should be \u201cno greater than that deserved for the\noffense committed\u201d and \u201cthe least severe measure necessary to achieve the purposes for\nwhich the sentence was imposed.\u201d Id. at \u00a7 40-35-103(2), (4).\n\n       When adjusting the length of a sentence within the appropriate range, a trial court\nis guided by, but not bound by, any applicable mitigating and enhancement factors. State\nv. Mosley, No. W2022-01424-CCA-R3-CD, 2024 WL 1406156, at *21 (Tenn. Crim. App.\nApr. 2, 2024) (quoting Bise, 380 S.W.3d at 706), perm. app. denied (Tenn. July 17, 2024).\nIt is within the trial court\u2019s sound discretion to weigh any applicable mitigating or\nenhancement factors. State v. Nelson, No. M2023-00176-CCA-R3-CD, 2024 WL\n1192985, at *15 (Tenn. Crim. App. Mar. 20, 2024) (quoting State v. Carter, 254 S.W.3d\n335, 345 (Tenn. 2007)), no perm. app. filed. Thus, \u201ca trial court\u2019s misapplication of an\nenhancement or mitigating factor does not invalidate the sentence imposed unless the trial\ncourt wholly departed\u201d from the sentencing act. Bise, 380 S.W.3d at 706.\n\n        Here, the trial court found that Defendant was a Range I, standard offender. See\nT.C.A. \u00a7 40-35-105. The trial court imposed within-range sentences for each conviction.\nSee id. \u00a7 -112(a)(2), (a)(4) (mandating that a Range I sentence be between eight and twelve\nyears for a Class B felony and between two and four years for a Class D felony).\nAdditionally, the trial court imposed partial consecutive sentencing. See id. \u00a7 -115(a)(5).\nDefendant does not challenge the manner or alignment of his sentences, and thus, this court\nwill focus solely on his challenge to the trial court\u2019s application of enhancement factors\nseven and fourteen.\n\n        Defendant asserts that, in applying enhancement factor seven, the trial court\nimproperly relied on the sexual nature of the offenses. Under Tennessee Code Annotated\nsection 40-35-114(7), a trial court may enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence within the\nappropriate range if it finds that the \u201coffense involved a victim and was committed to\ngratify the defendant\u2019s desire for pleasure or excitement[.]\u201d This factor may not be applied\nto sexual offenses that require proof of motive, such as sexual battery, but may be applied\nto sexual offenses that require no proof of motive, such as rape. State v. Kissinger, 922\nS.W.2d 482, 489-90 (Tenn. 1996) (noting that sexual battery requires proof that the\ndefendant made sexual contact, which is defined as intentional touching \u201cfor the purpose\nof sexual arousal or gratification\u201d). Neither especially aggravated sexual exploitation nor\n                                           - 10 -\n\faggravated statutory rape require proof of motive. See T.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 39-13-506(a), -17-\n1005(a), -17-1002(10).\n\n       \u201cEssential to proper application of this factor is the determination of the defendant\u2019s\nmotive for committing the offense.\u201d State v. Osborne, 251 S.W.3d 1, 26 (Tenn. Crim. App.\n2007) (citing State v. Arnett, 49 S.W.3d 250, 261 (Tenn. 2001)). The State must provide\n\u201cobjective evidence of the defendant\u2019s motivation to seek pleasure or excitement\u201d which\nmay include evidence of \u201csexually explicit remarks and overt sexual displays made by the\ndefendant, such as fondling or kissing a victim or otherwise behaving in a sexual\nmanner[.]\u201d State v. Tice, No. M2021-00495-CCA-R3-CD, 2022 WL 2800876, at *52\n(Tenn. Crim. App. July 18, 2022) (quoting Arnett, 49 S.W.3d at 262), perm. app. denied\n(Tenn. Dec. 14, 2022). The fact that the defendant orgasmed is insufficient, without more,\nto prove the existence of this factor. Kissinger, 922 S.W.2d at 491. \u201cThus, while this factor\ncan apply in a sexual offense, it must be shown that the circumstances surrounding the\noffense go beyond that which one would normally associate with sexual acts.\u201d State v.\nAllen, No. M2005-02808-CCA-R3-CD, 2006 WL 2380613, at *4 (Tenn. Crim. App. Aug.\n16, 2006).\n\n        Here, the trial court applied enhancement factor seven, finding that Defendant\nejaculated during the events and was in a relationship with the victim\u2019s mother. It\nexpressed confusion as to why Defendant entered a sexual relationship with the victim\ndespite having a consensual sexual relationship with the victim\u2019s mother. Further, the trial\ncourt considered the presentence report which established that the victim had told her sister\nthat she and Defendant had sex \u201ctoo many times to count,\u201d Defendant would \u201ctouch her\nbody all over before they had sex (breasts, legs, vagina),\u201d and Defendant told the victim he\nloved her and wanted to marry and have children with her. The victim also reported that\nafter she and Defendant had sex, he would insert his finger into her vagina. See State v.\nYelton, No. E2018-01436-CCA-R3-CD, 2019 WL 2475171, at *8 (Tenn. Crim. App. June\n13, 2019) (affirming application of enhancement factor seven because the \u201cevidence\npresented at trial and in the presentence report established that the [d]efendant kissed the\nvictim, fondled her breasts and buttocks, and inserted his finger into her vagina\u201d). The\nvictim\u2019s fifteen-year-old sister described when Defendant and the victim \u201cwere making a\nbet\u201d about whether the victim\u2019s sister would sleep with Defendant, a separate incident\nwhen Defendant sexually assaulted the victim\u2019s sister, and another incident when\nDefendant again propositioned the victim\u2019s minor sister, all of which support a finding that\nDefendant sought sexual interactions from the young girls to satisfy his desire for pleasure\nand excitement. The evidence supports the trial court\u2019s application of enhancement factor\nseven.\n\n       Next, Defendant contends that the trial court erred by applying enhancement factor\nfourteen. He notes that the State ultimately dismissed counts two through seven, and thus,\n                                            - 11 -\n\fDefendant \u201cdid not admit, even through virtue of his guilty plea, that he abused a position\nof public or private trust.\u201d Under Tennessee Code Annotated section 40-35-114(14), a trial\ncourt may enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence if the defendant abused a position of private trust\nin the commission of the offense. \u201c[A]pplication of the factor requires a finding, first, that\ndefendant occupied a position of trust\u201d and then a determination of \u201cwhether the position\noccupied was abused by the commission of the offense.\u201d Kissinger, 922 S.W.2d at 488.\nThe position of private trust is dependent on the nature of the relationship, not on the\nformality, and our supreme court has noted that the positions of \u201cparent, step-parent,\nbabysitter, teacher, [and] coach\u201d are a few \u201cobvious examples.\u201d Id. An adult who lives\nwith a minor \u201coccupies a position of \u2018presumptive private trust\u2019 with respect to the minor.\u201d\nState v. Gutierrez, 5 S.W.3d 641, 645 (Tenn. 1999).\n\n       Here, the trial court found that Defendant abused a position of private trust because\nDefendant told law enforcement that he occupied a \u201cparental role\u201d for the victim. The trial\ncourt further noted that Defendant lived in the home with the victim, dated and engaged in\na sexual relationship with the victim\u2019s mother, and the victim\u2019s mother \u201ctrusted him to\nleave the [victim] alone with him.\u201d These findings are more than adequately supported by\nthe record, particularly the presentence report which noted that Defendant stated that the\nvictim \u201clooked up to him,\u201d as well as the victim\u2019s sister\u2019s statement about the length of\ntime the family had known Defendant. See Kissinger, 922 S.W.2d at 489 (finding that the\ndefendant occupied a position of private trust because he had a long friendship with the\nvictims\u2019 mother and the victims\u2019 mother trusted him with the care of the boys); State v.\nChaves-Abrego, No. M2019-01686-CCA-R3-CD, 2021 WL 50252, at *9 (Tenn. Crim.\nApp. Jan. 6, 2021) (upholding trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant \u201cwas in a position of\nprivate trust with the victims\u2019 parents and that he abused that position of private trust\u201d\nwithout regard to whether the defendant was in a position of private trust with the minor\nvictims). The evidence supports the trial court\u2019s application of enhancement factor\nfourteen.\n\n        Finally, we note that even had we determined that the trial court erred in the\napplication of either or both enhancement factors discussed above, the trial court applied\ntwo other enhancement factors Defendant does not challenge. See State v. Ambrose, No.\nM2023-00097-CCA-R3-CD, 2024 WL 3596231, at *10 (Tenn. Crim. App. July 31, 2024)\n(citing State v. Dotson, 450 S.W.3d 1, 103 (Tenn. 2014)) (noting that \u201cthe application of a\nsingle enhancement factor supports an enhanced sentence\u201d), perm. app. denied (Tenn.

City of Portland, 306 Or 444, 448,\n760 P2d 252 (1988); Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers, 287 Or at\n602-03. In Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers, the court described\ncharacteristics that identify an adjudicative action:\n      \u201cGenerally, to characterize a process as an adjudication pre-\n      supposes that the process is bound to result in a decision and\n      that the decision is bound to apply preexisting criteria to con-\n      crete facts. * * * [A] further consideration has been whether\n      the action, even when the governing criteria leave much room\n      for policy discretion, is directed at a closely circumscribed\n      factual situation or a relatively small number of persons.\u201d\nId.\n        Our caselaw has come to recognize Strawberry Hill\n4 Wheelers as identifying three considerations that bear on\nthe determination whether a local government\u2019s process is\nadjudicative and therefore subject to a writ of review:\n     \u2022   Does the process, once begun, call for reaching a deci-\n         sion confined by preexisting criteria rather than by a\n         wide discretionary choice of action or inaction?\n     \u2022   To what extent is the decision-maker bound to apply\n         preexisting criteria to concrete facts?\n     \u2022   To what extent is the decision directed at a closely cir-\n         cumscribed factual situation or a relatively small num-\n         ber of persons?\nDodds, 222 Or App at 133 (noting that, in Strawberry Hill 4\nWheelers, \u201cthe Supreme Court explained that quasi-judicial\n\fCite as 339 Or App 27 (2025)                                                   31\n\ndecisions subject to writ of review are those processes that\nmeet three criteria\u201d); see also Hood River Valley v.

The\nthree considerations do not describe fixed elements of a quasi-\njudicial function but \u201ccharacteristics that might indicate that\na disputed action or decision-making process was judicial or\nquasi-judicial, as opposed to ministerial or legislative.\u201d Lane,\n310 Or App at 303-04 (quoting Hicks v. Central Point Sch. Dist.,\n270 Or App 532, 544, 348 P3d 307, rev den, 357 Or 743 (2015)).\nIf the writ-of-review process is available, the writ-of-review\nstatutes bar claims for declaratory or injunctive relief. ORS\n34.102 (stating that, if a writ of review is available, then the\ndecision must be reviewed under ORS 34.010 to ORS 34.102).\n         The determination whether the writ of review\nprocess was available here depends on whether the city\u2019s\naction was adjudicative, within the meaning of the term as\ndescribed in Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers. We therefore con-\nsider in more detail the largely undisputed facts giving rise\nto the current dispute.\n          It is undisputed that plaintiffs requested a permit\nfor the remodel of the ground-level commercial space of 1448\n28th Avenue. The materials submitted by plaintiffs did not\nrefer to a driveway and, on the submitted drawings, the area\nwhere the driveway curb cut sits was labeled \u201cwood fence.\u201d\n         The record shows that the city\u2019s actions consisted\nof the following: As required by Title 17 of the Portland\nCity Code (PCC), plaintiffs\u2019 application was reviewed by the\nPortland Bureau of Development Services (BDS) and Bureau\nof Transportation (PBOT). The review revealed a driveway\nand curb cut on plaintiffs\u2019 site and adjacent to the side of\nplaintiffs\u2019 building that did not comply with the PCC.1 In\n   1\n     PCC 17.28.110 provides, as relevant:\n       \u201cA. Purpose. Ensure that driveway locations promote the safe and\n   orderly flow of pedestrians, bicycles, and vehicular traffic, preserve on-street\n   parking, preserve or establish street trees, maximize opportunities for veg-\n   etated stormwater management, reduce conflicts with pedestrians and bicy-\n   cles and enhance the pedestrian environment.\n       \u201c* * * * *\n       \u201cC. Driveway definition: For the purposes of this Code section, a drive-\n   way is a gravel or paved way for vehicular traffic extending from the roadway\n\f32                      1448 28th Avenue, LLC v. City of Portland\n\nparticular, the driveway was closer than 25 feet from the\nintersection of NE 28th Avenue and NE Halsey Avenue.\nIt did not permit vehicles to exit in a forward motion, as\nrequired by the PCC for NE 28th Avenue, a \u201ccollector\u201d street.\nIn addition, the driveway was \u201ctoo narrow for modern vehic-\nular circulation under Portland City Code Requirements,\u201d\nhad a \u201cblind corner nearby,\u201d and was adjacent to \u201can inter-\nsection that has known safety problems\u201d and a \u201chistory of\ntraffic crashes going back many years.\u201d In fact, the driveway\ndid not meet the PCC definition of a \u201cdriveway,\u201d because it\ndid not access parking. Indeed, plaintiffs\u2019 application did not\neven identify the driveway; the curb cut area was labeled as\na \u201cwood fence.\u201d\n          Because plaintiffs\u2019 driveway was in violation of the\nPCC, plaintiffs\u2019 building-permit application triggered the\ncity to require either the removal or modification of the drive-\nway. Plaintiffs could have challenged the city\u2019s determina-\ntion through a driveway-design exception but they chose not\nto do so. And plaintiffs were not interested in attempting\nto modify the driveway. Instead, plaintiffs agreed to add a\ncurb to close the driveway. They completed an application\nfor a \u201cminor improvement permit,\u201d which allows them to add\na curb, so that the permitting process could continue. With\nthe addition of a curb as a condition, the city approved a per-\nmit for the remodel.\n        Several months later, plaintiffs sought a final occu-\npancy permit. But plaintiffs had not constructed the curb to\n     to the adjacent property line(s) for the purpose of providing access to parking\n     as provided under PCC Chapter 33.266.\n         \u201cD. Reconstruction and Revocation of Existing Driveways.\n         \u201c1. The Director of the Bureau of Transportation may revoke any drive-\n     way permit or require the modification of any driveway if:\n         \u201ca. The area occupied by the driveway is needed for right-of-way pur-\n     poses; or\n         \u201cb. Continued operation of the driveway interferes with the safe and\n     orderly flow of pedestrians, bicycles or vehicular traffic; or\n         \u201cc. The abutting owner has failed to comply with all specifications and\n     conditions of the permit; or\n         \u201cd. The driveway does not access a legal parking space on abutting prop-\n     erty per PCC Title 33.\n         \u201c2. The Council may revoke any driveway permit if it deems such action\n     will be in the public interest.\u201d\n\fCite as 339 Or App 27 (2025)                                      33\n\nclose the driveway, as permitted by the minor improvement\npermit. As a result, the city denied the request for a final\noccupancy permit, citing the permit\u2019s condition for removal\nof the driveway. In a letter to plaintiffs\u2019 legal counsel, the\ncity attorney explained:\n   \u201cThe applicant acquired a minor improvement permit to close\n   the driveway with this remodel work as a condition of PBOT\n   approving the building permit. This driveway closure con-\n   tinues to be required and final occupancy will not be issued\n   until such time as this driveway is permanently closed.\u201d\n         Plaintiffs objected, contending that the \u201chistoric res-\nidential driveway\u201d should not even have come into consider-\nation, because its use was only by the second-floor residential\nspace, which was not implicated by the remodeled ground-\nlevel commercial space. The city responded that it does not\nmatter which portion of the structure is being remodeled or\nwhether the space is commercial or residential\u2014the city\u2019s\nfocus for the driveway requirement is on the site, not the var-\nious uses of the site. And the city explained that, although\nthe city has authority under the PCC to require the removal\nor upgrade of any nonconforming driveway at any time (even\none that is \u201chistoric\u201d), its policy is to wait until a permit is\nsought for a development of the property before requiring an\nupgrade or removal of a nonconforming driveway.\n         Plaintiffs disagreed and chose to file this declar-\natory judgment action, which, as noted, the trial court\nrejected, concluding that it lacked jurisdiction. Plaintiffs\u2019\nprimary arguments under their single assignment of error\nare that the actions of the city on plaintiffs\u2019 permit were not\nquasi-judicial under the Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers criteria\nand, further, that the \u201chistoric residential driveway\u201d was\nnot implicated by the remodel of the commercial space.\n         The city responds that the city\u2019s decision to decline\nto issue the permanent occupancy permit until the driveway\nis removed falls within the quasi-judicial category described\nin Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers, and we agree.\n        We address each of the criteria.\n        Does the process, once begun, call for reaching a\ndecision confined by preexisting criteria rather than by a\n\f34                      1448 28th Avenue, LLC v. City of Portland\n\nwide discretionary choice of action or inaction? Plaintiffs\nrequested a final certificate of occupancy. The request would\neither be approved or denied and was thus bound to result in\na decision. And the city\u2019s decision to deny the request pend-\ning removal of the driveway was confined by preexisting cri-\nteria\u2014those rules set forth in the PCC relating to noncon-\nforming driveways and established city policy that upgrades\nto or removal of nonconforming driveways would be required\nupon application for development of a property.\n         To what extent is the decision-maker bound to apply\npreexisting criteria to concrete facts? The undisputed record\nshows that the city has fixed procedures and criteria that it\napplies in evaluating development permits and that, in mak-\ning the decision that plaintiffs were required to remove the\ndriveway before a final certificate of occupancy would be\nissued, the city applied those preexisting criteria, including\nthe rules set forth in the PCC. The undisputed record further\nshows that, in making the decision that the driveway must\nbe removed, the city made its determination based on undis-\nputed concrete facts.\n         To what extent is the decision directed at a closely\ncircumscribed factual situation or a relatively small number\nof persons? Plaintiffs concede that the city\u2019s decision was\ndirected at a closely circumscribed factual situation and a\nrelatively small number of persons.\n         The considerations identified by the Supreme Court\nin Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers each weigh in favor of a deter-\nmination that the city\u2019s action was \u201cadjudicative\u201d or quasi-\njudicial. The record further persuades us that the city\u2019s\naction falls within the adjudicative or quasi-judicial category\ndescribed in Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers and was therefore\nsubject to writ of review. For that reason, we conclude that\nthe trial court did not err in determining that it lacked juris-\ndiction to consider plaintiffs\u2019 declaratory judgment action.2\n           Affirmed.\n\n     2\n       Because we conclude that the trial court did not err in dismissing plaintiffs\u2019\ndeclaratory judgment claim for lack of jurisdiction, we need not address plain-\ntiffs\u2019 argument that the remodel of the commercial space did not implicate the\n\u201chistoric residential driveway.\u201d\n\f",

ORS\n34.102 (stating that, if a writ of review is available, then the\ndecision must be reviewed under ORS 34.010 to ORS 34.102).\n         The determination whether the writ of review\nprocess was available here depends on whether the city\u2019s\naction was adjudicative, within the meaning of the term as\ndescribed in Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers. We therefore con-\nsider in more detail the largely undisputed facts giving rise\nto the current dispute.\n          It is undisputed that plaintiffs requested a permit\nfor the remodel of the ground-level commercial space of 1448\n28th Avenue. The materials submitted by plaintiffs did not\nrefer to a driveway and, on the submitted drawings, the area\nwhere the driveway curb cut sits was labeled \u201cwood fence.\u201d\n         The record shows that the city\u2019s actions consisted\nof the following: As required by Title 17 of the Portland\nCity Code (PCC), plaintiffs\u2019 application was reviewed by the\nPortland Bureau of Development Services (BDS) and Bureau\nof Transportation (PBOT). The review revealed a driveway\nand curb cut on plaintiffs\u2019 site and adjacent to the side of\nplaintiffs\u2019 building that did not comply with the PCC.1 In\n   1\n     PCC 17.28.110 provides, as relevant:\n       \u201cA. Purpose. Ensure that driveway locations promote the safe and\n   orderly flow of pedestrians, bicycles, and vehicular traffic, preserve on-street\n   parking, preserve or establish street trees, maximize opportunities for veg-\n   etated stormwater management, reduce conflicts with pedestrians and bicy-\n   cles and enhance the pedestrian environment.\n       \u201c* * * * *\n       \u201cC. Driveway definition: For the purposes of this Code section, a drive-\n   way is a gravel or paved way for vehicular traffic extending from the roadway\n\f32                      1448 28th Avenue, LLC v. City of Portland\n\nparticular, the driveway was closer than 25 feet from the\nintersection of NE 28th Avenue and NE Halsey Avenue.\nIt did not permit vehicles to exit in a forward motion, as\nrequired by the PCC for NE 28th Avenue, a \u201ccollector\u201d street.\nIn addition, the driveway was \u201ctoo narrow for modern vehic-\nular circulation under Portland City Code Requirements,\u201d\nhad a \u201cblind corner nearby,\u201d and was adjacent to \u201can inter-\nsection that has known safety problems\u201d and a \u201chistory of\ntraffic crashes going back many years.\u201d In fact, the driveway\ndid not meet the PCC definition of a \u201cdriveway,\u201d because it\ndid not access parking. Indeed, plaintiffs\u2019 application did not\neven identify the driveway; the curb cut area was labeled as\na \u201cwood fence.\u201d\n          Because plaintiffs\u2019 driveway was in violation of the\nPCC, plaintiffs\u2019 building-permit application triggered the\ncity to require either the removal or modification of the drive-\nway. Plaintiffs could have challenged the city\u2019s determina-\ntion through a driveway-design exception but they chose not\nto do so. And plaintiffs were not interested in attempting\nto modify the driveway. Instead, plaintiffs agreed to add a\ncurb to close the driveway. They completed an application\nfor a \u201cminor improvement permit,\u201d which allows them to add\na curb, so that the permitting process could continue. With\nthe addition of a curb as a condition, the city approved a per-\nmit for the remodel.\n        Several months later, plaintiffs sought a final occu-\npancy permit. But plaintiffs had not constructed the curb to\n     to the adjacent property line(s) for the purpose of providing access to parking\n     as provided under PCC Chapter 33.266.\n         \u201cD.

The area occupied by the driveway is needed for right-of-way pur-\n     poses; or\n         \u201cb. Continued operation of the driveway interferes with the safe and\n     orderly flow of pedestrians, bicycles or vehicular traffic; or\n         \u201cc.

As a result, the city denied the request for a final\noccupancy permit, citing the permit\u2019s condition for removal\nof the driveway. In a letter to plaintiffs\u2019 legal counsel, the\ncity attorney explained:\n   \u201cThe applicant acquired a minor improvement permit to close\n   the driveway with this remodel work as a condition of PBOT\n   approving the building permit. This driveway closure con-\n   tinues to be required and final occupancy will not be issued\n   until such time as this driveway is permanently closed.\u201d\n         Plaintiffs objected, contending that the \u201chistoric res-\nidential driveway\u201d should not even have come into consider-\nation, because its use was only by the second-floor residential\nspace, which was not implicated by the remodeled ground-\nlevel commercial space. The city responded that it does not\nmatter which portion of the structure is being remodeled or\nwhether the space is commercial or residential\u2014the city\u2019s\nfocus for the driveway requirement is on the site, not the var-\nious uses of the site. And the city explained that, although\nthe city has authority under the PCC to require the removal\nor upgrade of any nonconforming driveway at any time (even\none that is \u201chistoric\u201d), its policy is to wait until a permit is\nsought for a development of the property before requiring an\nupgrade or removal of a nonconforming driveway.\n         Plaintiffs disagreed and chose to file this declar-\natory judgment action, which, as noted, the trial court\nrejected, concluding that it lacked jurisdiction. Plaintiffs\u2019\nprimary arguments under their single assignment of error\nare that the actions of the city on plaintiffs\u2019 permit were not\nquasi-judicial under the Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers criteria\nand, further, that the \u201chistoric residential driveway\u201d was\nnot implicated by the remodel of the commercial space.\n         The city responds that the city\u2019s decision to decline\nto issue the permanent occupancy permit until the driveway\nis removed falls within the quasi-judicial category described\nin Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers, and we agree.\n        We address each of the criteria.\n        Does the process, once begun, call for reaching a\ndecision confined by preexisting criteria rather than by a\n\f34                      1448 28th Avenue, LLC v. City of Portland\n\nwide discretionary choice of action or inaction? Plaintiffs\nrequested a final certificate of occupancy. The request would\neither be approved or denied and was thus bound to result in\na decision. And the city\u2019s decision to deny the request pend-\ning removal of the driveway was confined by preexisting cri-\nteria\u2014those rules set forth in the PCC relating to noncon-\nforming driveways and established city policy that upgrades\nto or removal of nonconforming driveways would be required\nupon application for development of a property.\n         To what extent is the decision-maker bound to apply\npreexisting criteria to concrete facts? The undisputed record\nshows that the city has fixed procedures and criteria that it\napplies in evaluating development permits and that, in mak-\ning the decision that plaintiffs were required to remove the\ndriveway before a final certificate of occupancy would be\nissued, the city applied those preexisting criteria, including\nthe rules set forth in the PCC. The undisputed record further\nshows that, in making the decision that the driveway must\nbe removed, the city made its determination based on undis-\nputed concrete facts.\n         To what extent is the decision directed at a closely\ncircumscribed factual situation or a relatively small number\nof persons? Plaintiffs concede that the city\u2019s decision was\ndirected at a closely circumscribed factual situation and a\nrelatively small number of persons.\n         The considerations identified by the Supreme Court\nin Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers each weigh in favor of a deter-\nmination that the city\u2019s action was \u201cadjudicative\u201d or quasi-\njudicial. The record further persuades us that the city\u2019s\naction falls within the adjudicative or quasi-judicial category\ndescribed in Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers and was therefore\nsubject to writ of review. For that reason, we conclude that\nthe trial court did not err in determining that it lacked juris-\ndiction to consider plaintiffs\u2019 declaratory judgment action.2\n           Affirmed.\n\n     2\n       Because we conclude that the trial court did not err in dismissing plaintiffs\u2019\ndeclaratory judgment claim for lack of jurisdiction, we need not address plain-\ntiffs\u2019 argument that the remodel of the commercial space did not implicate the\n\u201chistoric residential driveway.\u201d\n\f</pre>",

On the first day of trial, plaintiff,\nappearing pro se, informed the court that he intended to\npursue only the unpaid wages claim and wanted to drop the\nother claims. Trial was held on the unpaid wages claim, and\nthe court sitting as factfinder found in defendant\u2019s favor. All\nclaims were then dismissed with prejudice. Defendant filed\nan attorney fee statement, summarily asserting a right to\nfees and costs under \u201cORS 659A.885(8)(e), ORS 652.200, and\nORS 20.107.\u201d1 Plaintiff made no objection to the fee state-\nment. As part of its general judgment, the court awarded\n$37,343.08 in attorney fees and costs to defendant, which\nwas the full amount requested. The court did not identify\nthe statutory bases for the fee award, nor did it make any\nfindings.\n         On appeal, plaintiff raises three assignments of\nerror, all relating to the fee award. In his first assignment\nof error, plaintiff argues that the court erred in awarding\nfees on the wage claim. He assumes that the court did not\naward fees under the statute cited in the fee statement, ORS\n652.200, because it applies only to prevailing plaintiffs, and\ninstead awarded fees under ORS 20.105\u2014a statute never\nmentioned in the trial court but that provides for a fee award\nin a civil action if there \u201cwas no objectively reasonable basis\nfor asserting the claim\u201d\u2014and argues why it was error to do\nso. In response, defendant argues that it could have been\nawarded fees under ORS 653.055(4), another statute never\nmentioned below. In his second and third assignments of\nerror, plaintiff argues that the court\u2019s findings are inade-\nquate for meaningful appellate review.\n         It is true that the trial court\u2019s findings are inade-\nquate for meaningful appellate review. See Northwest Pump\n& Equipment Co. v. Stach, 167 Or App 64, 69, 1 P3d 466\n(2000) (\u201cWhile Oregon courts have broad discretion in setting\n    1\n      ORS 20.107 and ORS 659A.885(8)(e) pertain to discrimination claims. ORS\n652.200 pertains to claims for unpaid wages upon termination.\n\f224              Abualya v.

It is also true that the\nfee award on the wage claim is potentially problematic, inso-\nfar as the only statute cited as a basis for awarding fees on\nthat claim was a statute that, on its face, did not apply. See\nORS 652.200(1) (requiring fee award if the court \u201center[s]\njudgment for the plaintiff\u201d).\n          Ultimately, however, plaintiff\u2019s failure to object to\nthe fee statement in the trial court proceeding is dispositive.\nORCP 68 C(4)(f) provides, with respect to attorney fee state-\nments, that \u201c[i]f objections are not timely filed, the court may\naward attorney fees or costs and disbursements sought in\nthe statement.\u201d We have previously recognized the discre-\ntionary nature of \u201cmay\u201d and that the trial court may choose\nto independently assess the fee statement even absent objec-\ntions. Moreau v. Samalin, 295 Or App 534, 538, 435 P3d\n794 (2019) (\u201cEven when a fee petition is unopposed, the trial\ncourt may make its own assessment of the reasonableness of\nthe fees. See ORCP 68 C(4)(f); Council on Court Procedures,\nStaff Comment to ORCP 68, 32 (Dec 15, 1990) (the trial court\nhas \u2018discretion to pass on the reasonableness of the amounts\nclaimed,\u2019 even when there is no objection).\u201d). Plaintiff has\nnot developed any argument as to how, given ORCP 68 C(4)\n(f), it was an abuse of discretion to award fees and costs as\nrequested when no objection was filed, or why the court was\nrequired to make any findings under the circumstances. See\nMcCarthy v. Oregon Freeze Dry, Inc., 327 Or 185, 187 & n 2,\n957 P2d 1200 (1998) (explaining that \u201cthe objections of a\nparty who resists a petition for attorney fees play an import-\nant role in framing any issues that are relevant to the court\u2019s\ndecision to award or deny attorney fees\u201d and that \u201c[n]o party\nwill be heard to complain of the absence of a finding by the\ncourt on an issue that the party did not raise\u201d).\n        We therefore reject all three assignments of error,\nbased on the lack of any objection in the trial court, which\nallowed the court the option of simply awarding the full\namount requested without conducting an independent\nanalysis.\n        Affirmed.\n\f",

In his only counseled assignment of error,\npetitioner argues that the post-conviction court erred in\ndenying relief on his claim that trial counsel provided inad-\nequate and ineffective assistance by failing to advise him\nin late 2018, before he accepted a plea deal, that his con-\nduct did not constitute the crime of delivery of a controlled\nsubstance. In two pro se supplemental assignments of error,\npetitioner argues that the court also erred because trial\ncounsel provided inadequate and ineffective assistance by\nfailing to request a continuance at sentencing and because\nthe trial court made a comment during sentencing that was\nprejudicial to petitioner. We reject the pro se supplemental\nassignments of error without written discussion, for both\nprocedural and substantive reasons. As for the counseled\nassignment of error, we affirm for the reasons described\nbelow.\n         In October 2018, petitioner was arrested during a\ntraffic stop. The police searched petitioner\u2019s vehicle after\nthe arrest and found 30 grams of methamphetamine, 88.5\ngrams of heroin, a scale, a handgun, and two notebooks\nappearing to contain drug records. Petitioner was charged\nwith delivery of heroin, delivery of methamphetamine, felon\nin possession of a firearm, second-degree criminal posses-\nsion of a forged instrument, resisting arrest, identity theft,\nand first-degree theft. Two months later, pursuant to a plea\nagreement, he pleaded guilty to delivery of heroin, felon in\npossession of a firearm, and resisting arrest, and the remain-\ning charges were dismissed. After an unsuccessful direct\nappeal, petitioner sought post-conviction relief. He alleged,\namong other things, that trial counsel had provided inad-\nequate and ineffective assistance by failing to advise him\nthat his conduct did not constitute the crime of delivery of a\ncontrolled substance\u2014a claim that rested on the overruling\nof State v. Boyd, 92 Or App 51, 756 P2d 1276, rev den, 307 Or\n77 (1988), by State v. Hubbell, 314 Or App 844, 500 P3d 728\n(2021), aff\u2019d, 371 Or 340, 537 P3d 503 (2023), nearly three\nyears after petitioner pleaded guilty. The post-conviction\ncourt denied relief, and petitioner now appeals.\n\f84                                            Ayala v. Fhuere\n\n         A criminal defendant has the right to adequate and\neffective assistance of counsel under Article I, section 11, of\nthe Oregon Constitution and the Sixth Amendment to the\nUnited States Constitution. Antoine v. Taylor, 368 Or 760,\n767, 499 P3d 48 (2021). A violation of those rights entitles a\npetitioner to post-conviction relief. ORS 138.530(1)(a). Under\nthe Oregon Constitution, to succeed on a claim of inadequate\nassistance, petitioner must establish by a preponderance of\nthe evidence that \u201ccounsel failed to exercise reasonable pro-\nfessional skill and judgment, and that the petitioner suffered\nprejudice as a result.\u201d Johnson v. Premo, 361 Or 688, 699,\n399 P3d 431 (2017). \u201cA functionally equivalent two-element\nstandard governs petitioner\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance\nof counsel under the Sixth Amendment.\u201d Smith v. Kelly, 318\nOr App 567, 568-69, 508 P3d 77 (2022), rev den, 370 Or 822\n(2023).\n         In this case, the crux of petitioner\u2019s claim was that\nhis trial counsel was inadequate and ineffective for failing\nto foresee the change in the law that occurred when Hubbell\noverruled Boyd. He claims that his attorney should have\nforeseen that eventuality in 2018 and advised him accord-\ningly\u2014that is, advised him that, if he were convicted at trial\nof delivery of heroin or methamphetamine, those convictions\nmight be reversed on appeal if he challenged Boyd and we\nor the Supreme Court decided to overturn it, as ultimately\nhappened in Hubbell in 2021. We are unpersuaded.\n         In assessing a claim of inadequate assistance of\ncounsel, we \u201cmust make every effort to evaluate a lawyer\u2019s\nconduct from the lawyer\u2019s perspective at the time, without\nthe distorting effects of hindsight.\u201d Lichau v. Baldwin, 333\nOr 350, 360, 39 P3d 851 (2002). Absent some indication of\nan impending change in the law, defense counsel usually\ncannot be said to have provided inadequate or ineffective\nassistance by advising a defendant in accordance with then-\nexisting law, particularly when there is controlling prece-\ndent on the issue. Miller v. Lampert, 340 Or 1, 15-16, 125 P3d\n1260 (2006). Indeed, even when a legal issue is \u201cunsettled,\u201d\nan inadequate-assistance claim will prevail \u201conly if \u2018the\nstate of the law was so obviously ambiguous that any law-\nyer exercising reasonable professional skill and judgment\n\fCite as 339 Or App 82 (2025)                                85\n\nnecessarily would have seen it.\u2019 \u201d Curry v. Highberger, 326 Or\nApp 259, 264, 531 P3d 702, rev den, 371 Or 511 (2023) (quot-\ning Jackson v. Franke, 369 Or 422, 434, 507 P3d 222 (2022)).\n         In other words, it is not enough that, looking back,\n\u201ccounsel could have made a winning argument.\u201d Hagberg v.\nCoursey, 269 Or App 377, 382, 344 P3d 1118, rev den, 358 Or\n69 (2015). The petitioner must show that \u201cbased on the law\nas it existed at the time of [the petitioner\u2019s proceeding], any\nreasonably competent defense attorney would have made\nthe argument that was ultimately deemed meritorious in\n[a later case].\u201d Id.

New Jersey, 530\nUS 466, 120 S Ct 2348, 147 L Ed 2d 435 (2000), that sen-\ntence enhancement facts must be found by a jury. Similarly,\nin Kelly, 318 Or App at 569-70, we held that the petition-\ner\u2019s counsel did not perform deficiently, given existing law,\nwhere counsel did not foresee in 2015 that the United States\nSupreme Court would hold five years later in Ramos v.\nLouisiana, 590 US 83, 140 S Ct 1390, 206 L Ed 2d 583 (2020),\nthat nonunanimous guilty verdicts are unconstitutional.\n         Returning to the present case, Boyd was decided\nin 1988. It expressly held that a person could be convicted\nof the completed crime of delivery of a controlled substance\nbased on evidence that they possessed a large amount of a\ncontrolled substance with the intent to sell it. Boyd, 92 Or\nApp at 54-55 (so holding, based on our construction of ORS\n475.005(8), which defined \u201cdelivery\u201d to include \u201cattempted\ntransfer\u201d). That was the law for more than 30 years, until\n2021, when we overturned Boyd in Hubbell. Hubbell held that\npossession of a large amount of a controlled substance with\nthe intent to sell it could support a conviction for attempted\ndelivery, but that completed delivery required more. See\n\f86                                                         Ayala v.

In petitioner\u2019s view,\nhad counsel so advised him, he could and would have pro-\nceeded to trial, been convicted of the delivery counts, and\ngotten Boyd overturned on appeal in his own case, result-\ning in the reversal of those convictions (presumably to be\nreplaced with attempted delivery convictions).\n         We are unpersuaded that petitioner\u2019s counsel\u2019s\nreliance on Boyd while advising him in late 2018 reflects a\nfailure to exercise reasonable skill and judgment. Boyd had\nbeen controlling precedent for 30 years at that point, and its\ndemise was sudden. Indeed, even the defendant in Hubbell\ndid not foresee the change in the law\u2014we decided sua sponte\nto re-examine \u201cthe settled rule\u201d of Boyd in Hubbell and\nrequested supplemental briefing toward that end. Hubbell,\n314 Or App at 847; id. at 854 (explaining how we came to\ndecide to revisit Boyd). Controlling for the distorting effect\nof hindsight, we agree with the post-conviction court that\npetitioner\u2019s trial counsel did not fail to exercise reasonable\nprofessional skill and judgment by advising petitioner in a\nmanner consistent with then-existing law and without ref-\nerence to the possibility that Boyd could be overruled in the\nfuture. Accordingly, the post-conviction could did not err in\ndenying relief on the claim at issue.\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n    1\n      The legislature amended the delivery statutes in 2024 to effectively rein-\nstate the Boyd rule.

J.\n         Petitioner appeals the denial of his petition for post-\nconviction relief. In his only counseled assignment of error,\npetitioner argues that the post-conviction court erred in\ndenying relief on his claim that trial counsel provided inad-\nequate and ineffective assistance by failing to advise him\nin late 2018, before he accepted a plea deal, that his con-\nduct did not constitute the crime of delivery of a controlled\nsubstance. In two pro se supplemental assignments of error,\npetitioner argues that the court also erred because trial\ncounsel provided inadequate and ineffective assistance by\nfailing to request a continuance at sentencing and because\nthe trial court made a comment during sentencing that was\nprejudicial to petitioner. We reject the pro se supplemental\nassignments of error without written discussion, for both\nprocedural and substantive reasons. As for the counseled\nassignment of error, we affirm for the reasons described\nbelow.\n         In October 2018, petitioner was arrested during a\ntraffic stop. The police searched petitioner\u2019s vehicle after\nthe arrest and found 30 grams of methamphetamine, 88.5\ngrams of heroin, a scale, a handgun, and two notebooks\nappearing to contain drug records. Petitioner was charged\nwith delivery of heroin, delivery of methamphetamine, felon\nin possession of a firearm, second-degree criminal posses-\nsion of a forged instrument, resisting arrest, identity theft,\nand first-degree theft. Two months later, pursuant to a plea\nagreement, he pleaded guilty to delivery of heroin, felon in\npossession of a firearm, and resisting arrest, and the remain-\ning charges were dismissed. After an unsuccessful direct\nappeal, petitioner sought post-conviction relief. He alleged,\namong other things, that trial counsel had provided inad-\nequate and ineffective assistance by failing to advise him\nthat his conduct did not constitute the crime of delivery of a\ncontrolled substance\u2014a claim that rested on the overruling\nof State v.

State of Oregon\n\n         JACQUOT, J.\n          On appeal from a judgment denying post-conviction\nrelief, petitioner argues that the post-conviction court erred\nwhen it denied relief on his claims of ineffective assistance\nof trial and appellate counsel. Petitioner argues that trial\ncounsel was ineffective in failing to obtain additional police\nrecords regarding similar allegations made by the underage\nvictim against other people, and in failing to request a hear-\ning regarding the use of restraints on petitioner during his\nbench trial. Petitioner also argues that appellate counsel was\nineffective in not assigning error to the use of restraints or\nto the trial court compelling him to appear in prison clothing\nduring trial. We affirm.\n          We review the post-conviction court\u2019s denial of relief\nfor legal error. Green v. Franke, 357 Or 301, 312, 350 P3d 188\n(2015). We are bound by the post-conviction court\u2019s findings\nof historical fact if those findings are supported by the evi-\ndence in the record. Id. To succeed on a claim of inadequate\nassistance of counsel, a petitioner must show (1) that trial\ncounsel failed to exercise reasonable professional skill and\njudgment, and (2) that the petitioner suffered prejudice as\na result. Id. A petitioner may establish prejudice by demon-\nstrating that counsel\u2019s failure \u201ccould have tended to affect\u201d\nthe outcome of the proceedings, meaning more than \u201cmere\npossibility, but less than probability.\u201d Id. at 322-23.\n          In his first assignment of error, petitioner argues that\nthe post-conviction court erred when it denied his claim that\nhis trial counsel was inadequate in not obtaining additional\npolice records about prior similar allegations made by the\nvictim against others. The court denied relief, because coun-\nsel had presented evidence at trial that the victim had made\nprior allegations against others and \u201cvigorously argued these\npoints,\u201d including through an expert witness, and petitioner\ncould not show prejudice, because the records that petitioner\nalleged his trial counsel should have obtained did not contain\nany additional admissible information that was not presented\nat his trial.\n       Petitioner has not put forth any viable legal theory\nunder which the additional unobtained records could have\n\fNonprecedential Memo Op: 339 Or App 185 (2025)              187\n\nbeen admitted or used by trial counsel, nor has he shown\nthat the records contained anything that trial counsel had\nnot argued based upon the evidence that counsel did obtain.\nTherefore, petitioner has not shown that trial counsel\u2019s\nfailure to obtain the additional records could have tended\nto affect the outcome of the proceedings or that the post-\nconviction court erred in determining that trial counsel was\nnot ineffective in not obtaining additional police records.\n          In his second assignment of error, petitioner argues\nthat the post-conviction court erred when it denied his claim\nthat his trial counsel was inadequate in not objecting to the\ntrial court failing to make required findings on the record to\njustify the use of restraints. Upon trial counsel\u2019s request that\npetitioner not be restrained for trial, the trial court deferred\nto the jail\u2019s policy of keeping defendants in restraints during\nbench trials, and it assured petitioner and counsel that the\nrestraints would not impact its determinations in the case.\nThe deputy extended the restraint on petitioner\u2019s right hand\nso that he could write notes to his attorney during the pro-\nceedings. The court also would not allow petitioner to change\ninto civilian clothes.\n         A criminal defendant has the right to be free from\nphysical restraint during their trial, unless the court finds,\non the record, that there is evidence that the defendant poses\n\u201can immediate or serious risk of committing dangerous or\ndisruptive behavior, or * * * a serious risk of escape.\u201d State v.\nMcCright, 282 Or App 692, 700, 386 P3d 141 (2016). To show\nthat counsel was ineffective, a post-conviction petitioner\nmust prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that \u201ctrial\ncounsel\u2019s failure to object to the use of [restraints] without\nan adequate showing that petitioner posed a security risk\nhad a tendency to affect the result of his trial.\u201d Sproule v.\nCoursey, 276 Or App 417, 426, 367 P3d 946, rev den, 359 Or\n777 (2016) (internal quotation marks omitted). There are\nthree foundational types of prejudice that may result from\nerroneous restraint of a defendant during trial: \u201c(1) impinge-\nment on the presumption of innocence and the dignity of\njudicial proceedings; (2) inhibition of the accused\u2019s decision\nwhether to take the stand as a witness; and (3) inhibition of\nthe accused\u2019s consultation with his or her attorney.\u201d State v.\n\f188                           Chavez-Meza v. State of Oregon\n\nWall, 252 Or App 435, 442, 287 P3d 1250 (2012), rev den, 353\nOr 280 (2013). In addressing any potential prejudice from the\nuse of restraints, the question is whether there is a \u201cmaterial\nimpairment\u201d of those three interests. McCright, 282 Or App\nat 700. The concern for prejudice is less so in bench trials\nthan in jury trials, but it is nonetheless present. Id. at 701.\n         Here, the trial court erred because it did not make\nany findings regarding defendant\u2019s behavioral or escape risk,\ninstead relying solely on the jail\u2019s restraint policy. See id. at\n699-700 (trial court must make an independent determina-\ntion about the defendant\u2019s risk and cannot rely solely upon\nthe conclusions of others). However, that is not the issue in\nthis proceeding. The question before the post-conviction court\nwas whether trial counsel was ineffective in failing to request\na hearing or object to the trial court\u2019s failure to make the\nrequired findings, and whether petitioner suffered prejudice\nas a result. The post-conviction court denied relief for several\nreasons: Trial counsel did object to the use of restraints and\nwas repeatedly denied by the trial court; an accommodation\nwas made so that petitioner could take notes during the trial;\npetitioner was \u201cunable to show the use of restraints caused\nhim to appear guilty before the jury,\u201d because it was a bench\ntrial; the trial court repeatedly assured that the restraints\nwould not impact its determination; and petitioner did not\nshow that the restraints affected his ability to communicate\nwith his attorney or participate in the trial.\n        Petitioner has not provided any argument as to\nhow the post-conviction court\u2019s determination reflects legal\nerror. The court considered each of the types of prejudice\nand determined that petitioner did not meet his burden to\nshow that the erroneous restraint had a tendency to affect\nthe verdict, and its factual determinations are supported by\nevidence in the record. See State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Millican,\n138 Or App 142, 147-48, 906 P2d 857 (1995), rev den, 323\nOr 114 (1996) (finding harmless juvenile\u2019s shackling where\nthe juvenile court stated that the restraints \u201cwon\u2019t affect\nthe Court\u2019s view of the evidence here,\u201d and that, based upon\nthis court\u2019s independent review of the evidence, we did not\n\u201cbelieve that the trial court\u2019s credibility determinations\nwere impermissibly skewed\u201d).\n\fNonprecedential Memo Op: 339 Or App 185 (2025)            189\n\n         Regarding petitioner\u2019s argument that trial counsel\nwas ineffective in not preserving the issue of his errone-\nous restraint for appeal, as explained below, petitioner has\nnot shown that he would have succeeded on appeal even if\nthe argument had been preserved. Accordingly, the post-\nconviction court did not err in determining that trial coun-\nsel was not ineffective in failing to further object to the use\nof restraints.\n         Finally, in his third and fourth assignments of error,\npetitioner argues that appellate counsel was ineffective in\nfailing to assign error to the trial court\u2019s lack of findings\nto justify the restraints and to its decision that petitioner\ncould not wear his civilian clothes. To prevail on a claim of\nineffective assistance of appellate counsel, petitioner must\nestablish \u201c(1) that a competent appellate counsel would have\nasserted the claim, and (2) that had the claim of error been\nraised, it is more probable than not that the result would\nhave been different.\u201d Guinn v. Cupp, 304 Or 488, 496, 747\nP2d 984 (1987).\n          We have previously determined that, in a bench\ntrial, an error by the trial court in not making the required\nindividualized findings about a defendant\u2019s risk to justify\nrestraint is harmless, particularly when the trial court\nacknowledges that it will not allow the restraints to impact\nits decision. See, e.g., McCright, 282 Or App at 700; Millican,\n138 Or App at 147-48. Petitioner points to our comment in\nMcCright that when a trial is \u201cessentially, a credibility con-\ntest,\u201d erroneous restraint might not be harmless, as opposed\nto when there are no material factual disputes making \u201cthe\npotential for impermissible subconscious skewing\u201d of the\ntrial court\u2019s factual determinations \u201cnonexistent.\u201d 282 Or\nApp at 701 (internal quotation marks omitted). However, in\nthis posture, under the standard to prevail on a claim of\nineffective assistance of appellate counsel, petitioner must\nshow that it is \u201cmore probable than not\u201d that the claim\nwould have prevailed. Guinn, 304 Or at 496. Although a\ntrial with no factual disputes presents a \u201cnonexistent\u201d risk\nof impermissible subconscious skewing, that does not mean\nthat it is necessarily \u201cmore probable than not\u201d that any risk\ngreater than nonexistent would result in reversal on appeal.\n\f190                                 Chavez-Meza v. State of Oregon\n\nWe cannot say that the trial was solely a \u201ccredibility con-\ntest\u201d in the way that petitioner portrays, seeing as there was\nproof of communication between petitioner and the 12-year-\nold victim, and petitioner admitted to having sexual contact\nwith the victim.1 And, petitioner does not point to anything\nin the record to indicate that the trial court\u2019s credibility\ndeterminations were impermissibly skewed.\n          We do not imply here that, in a bench trial, the\npotential for unconscious bias against a restrained defen-\ndant does not exist, or that erroneous restraint will always\nbe harmless; nor do we downplay the affect that being held\nin restraints has on the presumption of innocence. See\nUnited States v. Sanchez-Gomez, 859 F3d 649, 661 (9th Cir\n2017), vac\u2019d on other grounds, 584 US 381, 138 S Ct 1532,\n200 L Ed 2d 792 (2018) (right against shackling absent indi-\nvidualized assessment of essential state interest applies in\nall proceedings, including bench trials, and \u201crespects our\nfoundational principle that defendants are innocent until\nproven guilty\u201d; courts \u201ccannot delegate this constitutional\nquestion to those who provide security\u201d); People v. Hamlett,\n193 NYS3d 658, 663, 80 Misc 3d 303, 307 (NY Crim Ct 2023)\n(\u201cIt cannot merely be assumed that judges are immune from\nthe prejudice and bias caused by visible shackles. We judges\nare human, and the sight of a defendant in restraints may\nunconsciously influence even a judicial factfinder.\u201d (Internal\nquotation marks omitted.)); People v. Williams, 2016 IL App\n(3d) 130901, \u00b6 30, 53 NE3d 1019, 1027 (2016) (\u201cAlthough the\npossibility of prejudicing the jury is a factor to be considered,\nthe reasons for forbidding shackling are not limited to trials\nby jury.\u201d). But in the posture and given the circumstances of\nthis case, we cannot say that it is more likely than not that\npetitioner would have prevailed on appeal.\n         Petitioner\u2019s argument that appellate counsel was\nineffective in failing to assign error to the trial court\u2019s denial\nof his request to appear in civilian clothing is also unavail-\ning. Petitioner provides no legal authority to show that,\neven had appellate counsel raised the issue on appeal, it\nwould have resulted in a reversal of petitioner\u2019s convictions.\n    1\n      Although petitioner later disputed the veracity of that confession, that\nissue was litigated through appeal unsuccessfully. State v. Chavez-Meza, 301 Or\nApp 373, 374 n 1, 456 P3d 322 (2019), rev den, 366 Or 493 (2020).\n\fNonprecedential Memo Op: 339 Or App 185 (2025)        191\n\nAccordingly, the post-conviction court did not err when it\ndetermined that appellate counsel was not ineffective.\n        Affirmed.\n\f",

Petitioner asserts that he is the biolog-\nical father of A and assigns error to the trial court\u2019s failure\nto determine paternity and to dismiss the guardianship. We\naffirm.\n         As the result of involvement with the Department\nof Human Services (DHS), and with A\u2019s mother\u2019s consent, A\u2019s\nmaternal grandmother became A\u2019s guardian in 2017. At that\ntime, petitioner was incarcerated. In 2022, A\u2019s mother moved\nto terminate the guardianship, a request she later withdrew.\nAfter A\u2019s mother made that motion, petitioner sought to inter-\nvene in the case, asserting that he was A\u2019s biological father. In\nsupport, petitioner alleged that he \u201ccontemporaneously filed\na Petition to Establish Custody, Parenting Time, and Child\nSupport in Jackson County Case No. 22DR20597, and expects\nto have paternity officially be established through that case.\u201d\nThe trial court granted petitioner\u2019s motion to intervene. At\npetitioner\u2019s request, the trial court ordered DNA testing for\nthe purpose of establishing paternity. Petitioner completed\nthe DNA test and filed the results with the court.\n        Petitioner next moved to dismiss the guardian-\nship proceeding, arguing that the result of the DNA testing\ndemonstrated that he was A\u2019s father:\n   \u201cPaternity has been established, and Intervenor is now\n   ready to assume custody of the child and provide for the\n   child\u2019s physical, mental, and emotional needs. It would be\n   in the best interests of the child for her to live with him,\n   and moreover Intervenor\u2019s rights as a parent necessarily\n   trump the interests of the Guardian/Grandparent.\u201d\nThe guardian opposed that request and asserted that pater-\nnity was not \u201cestablished\u201d because A\u2019s mother had been dat-\ning both petitioner and his \u201cbiologically similar\u201d brother at\nthe time A was conceived. Petitioner did not file a motion to\nestablish paternity, nor did he provide the court with the\nresults of the Jackson County case that he averred, in his\ninitial motion to intervene, would establish paternity.\n\f108                                                  Davis v. Deen\n\n       At the hearing on petitioner\u2019s motion to dismiss the\nguardianship, the trial court made several observations:\n       \u201cSo what I have in front of me now is a two-page\u2014it\u2019s a\n   one-and-a-half page motion to dismiss guardianship and a\n   one-page declaration with seven paragraphs, and there is\n   nothing\u2014there\u2019s a reference, the declaration by Mr. Davis\n   in paragraph 4, \u2018My paternity of [A] has been confirmed by\n   a court-ordered DNA test, the results of which are on file\n   with the court,\u2019 but that\u2014that is an evidentiary matter.\n      \u201c* * * * *\n       \u201cThe way Oregon evidence law requires hearings to be\n   conducted is there [are] exhibits and there is testimony, and\n   if there\u2019s an exhibit that is offered into evidence, the exhibit\n   needs to physically be offered, handed to the court clerk,\n   and it needs to be then determined whether or not it meets\n   the requirements of the law of evidence. If it does, the judge\n   is to rule that it\u2019s admitted into evidence. And there\u2019s also\n   testimony, and witnesses are sworn under oath, and they\n   testify, and that\u2019s what happens in judicial determinations.\n      \u201cAnd your motion is to dismiss a guardianship. It\u2019s not\n   a motion to adjudicate paternity that I see, so I\u2014I\u2019m not\n   quite sure procedurally what foundation exists.\u201d\nPetitioner\u2019s counsel responded that the court should take\njudicial notice of the result of the DNA testing that, according\nto petitioner, was already in the court record without other\nparties\u2019 objection. Petitioner further pointed to a statutory\nevidentiary presumption providing that a blood test that\nresults in a \u201ccumulative paternity index of 99 or greater\u201d cre-\nates a \u201cdisputable presumption of paternity.\u201d ORS 109.258. In\nresponse, guardian\u2019s counsel disputed petitioner\u2019s assertion\nthere was no objection to the blood test establishing paternity:\n   \u201cWe object to the paternity, and we don\u2019t think that a DNA\n   test alone in this circumstance is good enough, and we\u2019d be\n   happy to put evidence on if this was a hearing on paternity,\n   which it isn\u2019t.\u201d\nAfter hearing additional argument, the court ruled:\n       \u201cJudges are limited to making decisions based on what\n   is in front of the judge in a given case, in a given court\n   proceeding. What is in front of this court at this time is the\n   motion of [petitioner] to dismiss guardianship. * * *\n\fCite as 339 Or App 106 (2025)                                                109\n\n        \u201cThis court finds that a foundational requirement for\n    the court even to consider this matter is the establishment\n    of paternity. This court finds that paternity has not been\n    formally established. This court finds that a motion to\n    dismiss guardianship is not a proper procedural forum in\n    Coos County to pursue a determination of whether or not\n    there is paternity for [petitioner].\n        \u201cThat\u2019s particularly true because another proceeding is\n    now occurring in another circuit court in another county\n    in Oregon, specifically Jackson County, and under well-\n    established legal principles, where one proceeding is going\n    forward, a judge in another county can\u2019t simply jump in\n    and make determinations particularly where the motion to\n    determine paternity is not implicitly involved in a motion\n    to dismiss a guardianship.\u201d\nThe court denied the motion to dismiss, as well as petition-\ner\u2019s subsequent motion to reconsider. This appeal followed.\n         On appeal, petitioner argues that the trial court\nerred by not determining that petitioner established paternity\nof A and also erred in denying petitioner\u2019s motion to dismiss\nthe guardianship. In his first assignment of error, petitioner\nrenews the arguments he made below; that, pursuant to ORS\n109.258, the DNA test itself established paternity. Deferring\nto the trial court\u2019s factual findings that are supported by evi-\ndence in the record, we review the trial court\u2019s legal conclu-\nsions for legal error. Caswell v. Day Law and Associates, P. C.,\n309 Or App 367, 375, 481 P3d 972 (2021); Brown v. MacDonald\nand Associates, LLC, 260 Or App 275, 277, 317 P3d 301 (2013).1\n         The trial court did not err. As the trial court rec-\nognized, petitioner moved to terminate the guardianship,\nnot to establish paternity. Petitioner did not file a motion\nto establish, nor request an evidentiary hearing regarding,\npaternity. See, e.g., State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. L. V., 219 Or\nApp 207, 211, 182 P3d 866 (2008) (explaining that, after\nfather completed court-ordered genetic testing, \u201cDHS moved\nto establish [father\u2019s] legal paternity under ORS 419B.395\nand ORS 109.258\u201d). Rather, petitioner insisted that no such\nefforts were necessary despite the guardian\u2019s objections\n    1\n      Petitioner requests that we review the trial court\u2019s factual findings de novo\npursuant to ORS 19.415, however, the basis upon which we affirm the trial court\ndoes not involve any factual determinations.\n\f110                                                             Davis v. Deen\n\nto paternity. And, despite the court explaining the proper\npath for petitioner to proceed to present evidence regard-\ning paternity, petitioner insisted that no further steps were\nrequired.\n        As we understand petitioner\u2019s argument, he con-\ntends that ORS 109.2582 required that the trial court deter-\nmine, as a matter of law, that petitioner is A\u2019s father. ORS\n109.258, however, contains no such mandate.\n           ORS 109.258 \u201cprovides that, in a paternity adjudica-\ntion, \u2018[a] disputable presumption of paternity is created if one\nor more blood tests [including DNA tests] result in a cumu-\nlative paternity index of 99 or greater.\u2019 \u201d Sause and Schnitzer,\n371 Or 573, 594, 539 P3d 722 (2023) (emphasis added) (quot-\ning ORS 109.258). The statute is intended \u201cto help resolve evi-\ndentiary disputes over the efficacy of blood tests in identify-\ning putative fathers.\u201d Id. at 597. Accordingly, it does not itself\ncreate a proceeding to establish paternity; rather, it dictates\nhow a trial court must view blood tests in such a proceeding.\nSee id. at 598 (\u201cFor a blood test to lead to legal parentage, as\nORS 109.258 contemplates, there must be an adjudication or\nother proceeding.\u201d); see also ORS 109.124 to 109.230 (estab-\nlishing procedures for filiation proceedings, including who\nmay initiate, where proceedings must occur, and contents of\nhearing). To aid a trial court in making a paternity determi-\nnation in those proceedings, ORS 109.258 creates an eviden-\ntiary presumption \u201cthat may or may not lead to a determina-\ntion of legal parentage.\u201d Sause, 371 Or at 597.\n         Petitioner may be correct that, in certain proceed-\nings,3 he would be entitled to an evidentiary presumption of\n    2\n      ORS 109.258 provides:\n        \u201cA disputable presumption of paternity is created if one or more blood\n    tests result in a cumulative paternity index of 99 or greater. If the court\n    or administrator finds that the conclusions of all the experts, as disclosed\n    by the evidence based upon the tests, are that the alleged father is not the\n    father of the child, the question of paternity shall be resolved accordingly. If\n    the experts disagree in their findings or conclusions, the question shall be\n    submitted upon all the evidence.\u201d\n    3\n      We observe that the proceedings contemplated by the chapter containing\nthat evidentiary presumption do not include guardianship proceedings under\nORS chapter 125. ORS 109.252 (\u201cUnless the court or administrator finds good\ncause not to proceed in a proceeding under ORS 25.501 to 25.556, 109.124 to\n109.230 or 419B.609, in which parentage is a relevant fact, the court * * * upon\n\fCite as 339 Or App 106 (2025)                                                111\n\npaternity based on his blood test. A motion to terminate a\nguardianship, however, is not a proceeding to establish par-\nentage. In the absence of such a proceeding, an evidentiary\npresumption does not automatically establish paternity as a\nmatter of law.4\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\nmotion of any party to the action made at a time so as not to delay the proceedings\nunduly shall, order the mother, child, alleged father and any other named respon-\ndent who may be the father to submit to blood tests.\u201d).\n     4\n       Because we conclude that the trial court\u2019s determination that petitioner\nfailed to take the proper procedural steps to establish paternity was sufficient\nto support its decision, we do not address petitioner\u2019s second assignment of error,\nwhich challenges an alternate basis to support the same ruling. See Allianz\nGlobal Risks v. ACE Property & Casualty Ins. Co., 297 Or App 434, 439, 442 P3d\n212 (2019), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 367 Or 711 (2021) (recognizing that an affir-\nmance of a trial court\u2019s ruling on one basis obviates the need to reach arguments\nchallenging alternate bases supporting trial court\u2019s decision). Our disposition\nalso obviates the need to address petitioner\u2019s third assignment of error, which\nrelies on the premise that paternity was established to challenge the denial of the\nmotion to dismiss the guardianship.\n\f",

B. C. B.\n\n        JOYCE, J.\n         In this juvenile dependency case, father appeals\nfrom a judgment of the juvenile court that took jurisdiction\nover his three children. As we explain below, as to the alle-\ngation that jurisdiction was justified because father\u2019s mental\nhealth problems interfere with his ability to safely parent\nthe children, we agree that the evidence was insufficient to\nsupport that basis on which the juvenile court took jurisdic-\ntion. As to the other bases on which the juvenile court took\njurisdiction, having reviewed the record, we conclude that\nthe court did not err. Accordingly, we reverse and remand\nfor entry of a judgment omitting allegation 2(E) as a basis\nfor jurisdiction and otherwise affirm.\n         We review the sufficiency of the evidence support-\ning dependency jurisdiction by \u201cview[ing] the evidence, as\nsupplemented and buttressed by permissible derivative\ninferences, in the light most favorable to the trial court\u2019s\ndisposition and assess[ing] whether, when so viewed, the\nrecord was legally sufficient to permit that outcome.\u201d Dept.\nof Human Services v. N. P., 257 Or App 633, 639, 307 P3d 444\n(2013). \u201cTo establish a basis for juvenile court jurisdiction\nfor purposes of ORS 419B.100(1)(c), the state must prove, by\na preponderance of the evidence, ORS 419B.310(3), that a\nchild\u2019s welfare is endangered because, under the totality of\nthe circumstances, there is a current threat of serious loss\nor injury to the child that is reasonably likely to be real-\nized.\u201d Dept. of Human Services v. K. C. F., 282 Or App 12, 19,\n383 P3d 931 (2016) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n        The juvenile court took jurisdiction over the three\nchildren on several jurisdictional bases:\n  \u2022   Father has exposed the children to domestic violence\n      against mother;\n  \u2022   Father has physically abused the children and caused\n      them emotional distress;\n  \u2022   Father \u201chas mental health issues which impair his\n      judgment and ability to safely parent the children\u201d; and\n  \u2022   Two of the three children are fearful of returning to\n      father\u2019s care.\n\fNonprecedential Memo Op: 339 Or App 176 (2025)              179\n\n         On the record before us, we readily conclude that\nthe juvenile court correctly took jurisdiction on the first two\nbases, involving domestic violence and physical abuse. As\nto the allegation that two of the three children are afraid of\nreturning to father\u2019s care, father argues that there is no evi-\ndence that the two children\u2019s fear of father exposed the third\nchild\u2014who did not share that same fear\u2014to a risk of harm,\nsuch to support taking jurisdiction over the third child on\nthat basis. Whatever merit that argument may have, father\ndid not make that argument to the juvenile court; his argu-\nment is thus unpreserved, and we decline to address it. See\nDept. of Human Services v. C. M., 284 Or App 521, 530-31,\n392 P3d 820 (2017) (rejecting as unpreserved an argument\nthat the evidence was insufficient to support a jurisdictional\nallegation where the parent failed to challenge that basis\nbelow).\n         We reach a different conclusion with respect to\nthe allegation that father\u2019s mental health interferes with\nhis ability to parent. The evidence related to that allega-\ntion came from the testimony of two of the children, who\ndescribed that father \u201cwent a little crazy\u201d at one point,\nsomeone had put a \u201cspell\u201d or \u201chex\u201d on father, and he was\n\u201cseeing things.\u201d It is not apparent from the record that that\nevidence reflects \u201cmental health issues\u201d; to the extent that\nthe court relied on that evidence, without more information\nabout father\u2019s condition, it is insufficient in any event to sup-\nport a conclusion that there is a reasonable risk of harm to\nthe children as a result. See K. C. F., 282 Or App at 19-20\n(the record lacks evidence of the \u201cserious loss or injury to the\nchild that is reasonably likely to be realized\u201d with respect\nto the allegation (internal quotation marks omitted)). We\ntherefore reverse and remand the jurisdictional judgment\nfor the court to enter a judgment omitting allegation 2(E) as\na basis for jurisdiction.\n         Reversed and remanded for entry of judgment omit-\nting allegation 2(E) as a basis for jurisdiction; otherwise\naffirmed.\n\f",

H., 373 Or 26, 48-49, 559 P3d 395 (2024), and\naffirm.\n         We have reviewed the evidence and the juvenile\ncourt\u2019s findings and conclude that the juvenile court cor-\nrectly found that DHS made reasonable efforts and that\nfather had not made sufficient progress to have R return\nhome. In particular, as the juvenile court found, DHS offered\nfather extensive services over several years and father did\nnot engage in those services, save for visits. Although father\nargues that the services were not aimed at ameliorating\nthe single jurisdictional basis\u2014that father \u201cdoes not under-\nstand the basic needs of the child and lacks the skills and/or\nknowledge necessary to safely parent\u201d R\u2014the record reflects\nthat the services were directly related to that jurisdictional\nbasis. Given father\u2019s failure to engage in those services and\ngiven father\u2019s concerning conduct during the single service\nhe did engage in (visits), the juvenile court correctly con-\ncluded that father had not made sufficient progress to enable\nR to return to his care.\n        Affirmed.\n\f",

Plaintiff\nconcedes that we need to address the evidentiary issue only if\nwe agree with plaintiff on the instruction issue. We conclude\nthat the trial court did not err and therefore affirm.\n         Plaintiff brought this negligence action against\ndefendant alleging that she was injured when, as she walked\nout of defendant\u2019s Wood Village store while leaving a voice-\nmail message on her cell phone, she slipped on a three-foot\nby five-foot laminated plastic sign, which had fallen from its\nstand onto the public walkway. Plaintiff alleged that she was\ninjured when she slipped on the sign, causing her right foot\nto slip from underneath her, and her left knee, hand, and\nshoulder to hit the ground. Plaintiff alleged that defendant\nwas negligent in securing the sign, in failing to discover that\nthe sign was on the ground, in failing to barricade the area,\nand in failing to monitor the public entryway of the store.\nPlaintiff sought damages for medical bills of $395,169.02 for\nthree back surgeries and other medical treatments, and for\nfuture projected medical bills of $60,000, and sought non-\neconomic damages of $1,000,000.\n         The sign belonged to defendant\u2019s Starbucks conces-\nsion, which was inside defendant\u2019s store. The Starbucks is\nrun by defendant\u2019s employees. It is undisputed that defen-\ndant\u2019s employees did not place the sign on the ground and\ndid not know that it had fallen out of its frame. Plaintiff did\nnot assert that defendant had constructive knowledge that\nthe sign was on the ground.\n         Plaintiff conceded below that res ipsa loquitur does\nnot apply to typical slip-and-fall claims, which typically\ninvolve substances on a floor that might have been handled\n\f114                                     Fisk v. Fred Meyer Stores, Inc.\n\nby customers. But plaintiff distinguished this claim from\nthose, arguing that plaintiff\u2019s claim was more in the nature\nof a \u201cstandard\u201d \u201cconditions\u201d claim, because the sign was not\na substance or thing normally handled by a customer and\nwas within defendant\u2019s exclusive control. Plaintiff requested\na uniform jury instruction on res ipsa loquitur, contending\nthat the evidence was sufficient to give the jury a rational\nbasis to find that it was more probable than not that defen-\ndant\u2019s failure to exercise reasonable care was the cause of\nthe accident.1 The requested res ipsa loquitur instruction\nstated:\n    \u201cThe law assumes that all persons have obeyed the law and\n    have been free from negligence.\n    \u201cHowever, you may find that the defendant was negligent if\n    you find that the incident that caused damage to the plain-\n    tiff is one that, in the normal course of events, would not\n    have occurred unless the defendant was negligent.\u201d\n\n    1\n      We recently discussed res ipsa loquitur in Jackson v. KA-3 Associates, LLC,\n331 Or App 574, 546 P3d 950, rev allowed, 373 Or 81, 546 P3d 950 (2024):\n         \u201cIn the absence of evidence of negligence or the exact cause of an acci-\n    dent, a factfinder can infer negligence and causation under res ipsa loquitur,\n    a rule of circumstantial evidence, if the \u2018accident is of a kind which ordinarily\n    would not have occurred in the absence of the defendant\u2019s negligence, even\n    though it is impossible to determine the specific way in which the defendant\n    was negligent.\u2019 [Hagler v. Coastal Farm Holdings, Inc., 354 Or 132, 146, 309\n    P3d 1073 (2013)]. The plaintiff bears the burden of submitting evidence that\n    the plaintiff\u2019s injury is of the sort that, more likely than not, was caused by\n    negligence on the part of the defendant and therefore is entitled to an infer-\n    ence of negligence under res ipsa loquitur. Id. Whether a reasonable juror\n    could draw such an inference is an issue of law to be determined by the court.\n    Fieux v. Cardiovascular & Thoracic Clinic, P.C., 159 Or App 637, 640, 978 P2d\n    429, rev den, 329 Or 318 (1999).\n         \u201cIn Ritchie v. Thomas et al., 190 Or 95, 114, 224 P2d 543 (1950), the\n    court explained that res ipsa loquitur is a rule of evidence that allows an\n    inference of negligence, rather than a presumption, under certain limited\n    circumstances:\n         \u201c \u2018[T]he fact of injury alone does not raise an inference of negligence. An\n    inference of negligence may arise only when injury is caused by an instru-\n    mentality which is under the control and management of the defendant, and\n    when the accident is such as, in the ordinary course of events does not hap-\n    pen, if those who have the management use ordinary care.\u2019 \u201d\n331 Or App at 582. See also Kaufman v. Fisher, 230 Or 626, 636-40, 371 P2d 948\n(1962) (describing the question under res ipsa loquitur thusly: \u201cCould it have been\nreasonably found by the jury that the accident which occurred in this case is of\na kind which more probable than not would not have occurred in the absence of\nnegligence upon the part of [the defendant]?\u201d).\n\fCite as 339 Or App 112 (2025)                                    115\n\n        The court declined to give the res ipsa loquitur\ninstruction, explaining,\n   \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a situation for res ipsa because that would\n   require * * * that the sign and the A-frame be in the exclu-\n   sive control or almost exclusive control of the Defendant.\n   And being in a public area like that, * * * I don\u2019t think\n   there\u2019s a basis for that.\u201d\nInstead, the court gave general instructions relating to\npremises liability as well as an instruction on slip-and-fall:\n   \u201cA possessor of premises has a duty to make the premise\n   reasonably safe for an invitee\u2019s visit. The possessor must\n   exercise reasonable care to discover any condition that cre-\n   ates an unreasonable risk of harm to the invitee and either\n   eliminate the condition or warn any foreseeable invitee of\n   the risk so the invitee can avoid the harm. If the condition\n   cannot be encountered with reasonable safety, even if the\n   danger was known and appreciated by the invitee, the pos-\n   sessor is obligated to do more than warn. The possessor\n   must take reasonable and feasible steps to eliminate the\n   danger.\n   \u201cOregon law does not automatically impose liability against\n   a business for every slip and fall accident that occurs on the\n   premises. The role of the possessor is not that of an insurer\n   against accidents upon the premises, even as to persons who\n   they have invited to appear. Excuse me. Invited to enter.\n   The mere fact that an invitee was injured on the premises\n   does not, by itself, give rise to an inference of negligence.\n   \u201cIn premises liability cases like this one, where the Plaintiff\n   claims to have been injured by slipping on a sign on the\n   ground of the Defendant\u2019s store, liability will not attach\n   unless the Defendant had actual or constructive knowledge\n   of the sign on the ground and failed to use reasonable care\n   to remove it.\n   \u201cTo prove the Defendant had knowledge of the sign on the\n   ground the Plaintiff must prove one of three things: (1) the\n   sign was placed on the ground by the Defendant, or (2) the\n   Defendant knew that the sign was there and failed to use\n   reasonable diligence to remove it, or (3) the sign had been\n   on the ground for such a length of time that the Defendant\n   should, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, have discov-\n   ered it and removed it.\u201d\n\f116                            Fisk v. Fred Meyer Stores, Inc.\n\n         The jury returned a verdict for defendant. On\nappeal, plaintiff does not assign error to the instructions\nthat the trial court gave or to the trial court\u2019s characteri-\nzation of the claim as involving a slip and fall but argues\nthat the court erred in failing to give plaintiff\u2019s requested\nres ipsa loquitur instruction. \u201cAs a general rule, parties in\na civil action are entitled to jury instructions on their the-\nory of the case if their requested instructions correctly state\nthe law, are based on the current pleadings in the case, and\nare supported by evidence.\u201d Vandeveere-Pratt v. Portland\nHabilitation Center, 242 Or App 554, 557-58, 259 P3d 9\n(2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). Plaintiff con-\ntends that the evidence at trial supported the giving of the\nres ipsa loquitur instruction and that the trial court erred\nin reasoning that res ipsa loquitur was precluded by the fact\nthat the sign was located in a public area and therefore not\nwithin defendant\u2019s exclusive control.\n          Defendant responds, as argued below, that plain-\ntiff\u2019s claim is a \u201cslip and fall\u201d claim to which the doctrine\nof res ipsa loquitur does not apply. See German v. Kienow\u2019s\nFood Stores, 246 Or 334, 336, 425 P2d 523 (1967) (stating\nthat Oregon has not \u201cyet adopted the rule of res ipsa loqui-\ntur in \u2018slip and fall\u2019 cases, and it is still necessary to supply\nsome proof of fault\u201d). Defendant argues, further, that it was\nnot defendant\u2019s burden to show that the sign was not within\ndefendant\u2019s exclusive control but plaintiff\u2019s burden to show\nthat the sign and its frame were within defendant\u2019s exclusive\ncontrol, and that she has failed to do that. In her reply brief,\nplaintiff argues that res ipsa loquitur does not depend on the\n\u201cmechanism of injury,\u201d i.e., whether the injury occurred as a\nresult of a slip and fall, but on whether the evidence would\nallow a finding that the probability of the defendant\u2019s negli-\ngence is greater than the probability of other causes.\n        As the trial court correctly instructed, the general\nrule of premises liability is that possessors of land must\n\u201cmake their property reasonably safe for their invitees.\u201d\nHughes v. Wilson, 345 Or 491, 497, 199 P3d 305 (2008). That\nduty requires the possessor to exercise due care to discover\nconditions on the premises that create an unreasonable risk\nof harm to invitees or warn them of the risk so as to enable\n\fCite as 339 Or App 112 (2025)                                  117\n\nthem to avoid the harm. Woolston v. Wells, 297 Or 548, 557-\n58, 687 P2d 144 (1984).\n          Our caselaw and that of the Supreme Court make\nclear that slip-and-fall claims involving substances or objects\non the floor or ground are simply a subcategory of premises\nliability to which general premises liability standards apply.\nHagler v. Coastal Farm Holdings, Inc., 354 Or 132, 141, 309\nP3d 1073 (2013); Moorehead v. Tri-Met, 273 Or App 54, 359\nP3d 314 (2015), rev den, 358 Or 550 (2016) (\u201cWe conclude that\nthe distinction plaintiff seeks to draw between \u2018condition\u2019\ncases and \u2018foreign substance\u2019 cases is nonexistent.\u201d). When a\nclaim involves a substance or object on the floor or ground,\nthe liability of a business owner depends on evidence that\nthe owner knew or should have known about the fallen sub-\nstance or object. Hagler, 354 Or at 142. In the context of a\nslip-and-fall claim, proof of that liability is captured by the\nthree-factor test described in the caselaw:\n      \u201c(a) That the substance was placed there by the occu-\n   pant, or\n      \u201c(b) That the occupant knew that the substance was\n   there and failed to use reasonable diligence to remove it, or\n       \u201c(c) That the foreign substance had been there for such\n   a length of time that the occupant should, by the exercise of\n   reasonable diligence, have discovered and removed it.\u201d\nCowden v. Earley et al, 214 Or 384, 387, 327 P2d 1109 (1958).\n         Although reported slip-and-fall cases have most\ngenerally involved foreign substances on a floor that cause\na person to slip, Oregon courts have also applied slip-and-\nfall analysis to cases in which an invitee slips on or trips\nover an object in the aisle of a store. See, e.g., Lee v. Meier &\nFrank Co., 166 Or 600, 114 P2d 136 (1941) (holding that a\ncustomer who had tripped over a pillow in the aisle of a store\nfailed to state a claim against the owner of the store); see\nalso Hinchman v. UC Market, LLC, 270 Or App 561, 567 n 3,\n348 P3d 328 (2015) (observing that \u201cslip and fall\u201d analysis\napplied in a claim involving a negligently placed door mat).\n          We agree with defendant that because plain-\ntiff slipped on an object on the ground, plaintiff\u2019s claim is\ncorrectly characterized as a slip-and-fall claim. The trial\n\f118                                    Fisk v. Fred Meyer Stores, Inc.\n\ncourt\u2019s jury instructions therefore correctly described plain-\ntiff\u2019s burden. And, as the Supreme Court held in Kienow\u2019s\nFood Stores, 246 Or at 336, the trial court correctly held\nthat, because the claim involved a slip and fall, the doctrine\nof res ipsa loquitur did not apply.2\n         But even if plaintiff were correct that res ipsa loqui-\ntur could apply in the context of this slip-and-fall claim,\nwe would conclude that the trial court did not err in reject-\ning the requested res ipsa loquitur instruction here. That\nis because, in determining whether to give the requested\ninstruction, it was the trial court\u2019s role to determine whether\nthere was evidence from which the jury could find that the\naccident was of a kind more likely than not attributable to\ndefendant\u2019s negligence. Hammer v. Fred Meyer Stores, Inc.,\n242 Or App 185, 194, 255 P3d 598 (2011) (\u201c \u2018The determina-\ntion of where the probabilities lie must, ordinarily, be made\nupon the basis of past experience as it is seen and appraised\nby the court.\u201d\u2019 (quoting Kaufman, 230 Or at 639)). As the\ntrial court concluded, a jury could not plausibly have found\nthat it was more probable than not that defendant\u2019s failure\nto exercise reasonable care was the cause of the accident,\nbecause there were a number of causes other than defen-\ndant\u2019s alleged negligence that could have caused the sign to\nbe on the ground and plaintiff to fall. See Hammer, 242 Or\nApp at 190-91 (\u201cRes ipsa loquitur is a rule of circumstantial\nevidence that permits a jury to infer both negligence and\ncausation if the harm that occurs is \u2018\u201dof a kind that which\nmore probably than not would not have occurred in the\nabsence of negligence on the part of the defendant\u201d\u2019 McKee\nElectric Co. v. Carson Oil Co., 301 Or 339, 353, 723 P2d 288\n(1986) (quoting Watzig v. Tobin, 292 Or 645, 649, 642 P2d\n651 (1982)).\u201d). We conclude, therefore, that the trial court did\nnot err in declining to give plaintiff\u2019s requested instruction.\n         Plaintiff concedes that her second assignment of\nerror, in which she contends that the trial court erred in\n\n     2\n       We do not conclude here that res ipsa loquitur could never apply to a claim\nin which a business invitee slips and falls in the defendant\u2019s premises. But appli-\ncation of the presumption of res ipsa loquitur to a claim like plaintiff\u2019s, where,\nas here, a business invitee slips on a substance or object on the business own-\ner\u2019s floor or ground, is inconsistent with the three-factor inquiry that generally\napplies to the determination of liability in those types of cases.\n\fCite as 339 Or App 112 (2025)                             119\n\nadmitting testimony of plaintiff\u2019s treating physician, is con-\ntingent on our acceptance of plaintiff\u2019s first assignment of\nerror, and we therefore do not reach it.\n        Affirmed.\n\f",

The Starbucks is\nrun by defendant\u2019s employees. It is undisputed that defen-\ndant\u2019s employees did not place the sign on the ground and\ndid not know that it had fallen out of its frame. Plaintiff did\nnot assert that defendant had constructive knowledge that\nthe sign was on the ground.\n         Plaintiff conceded below that res ipsa loquitur does\nnot apply to typical slip-and-fall claims, which typically\ninvolve substances on a floor that might have been handled\n\f114                                     Fisk v.

The possessor\n   must take reasonable and feasible steps to eliminate the\n   danger.\n   \u201cOregon law does not automatically impose liability against\n   a business for every slip and fall accident that occurs on the\n   premises.

Our conclusion that DHS failed to prove that petitioner intentionally\nfailed to report her household composition resolves that allegation and obviates\nthe need to address the third assignment.\n\f172                      Garrett-Sims v. Dept. of Human Services\n\nmember of [her] household.\u201d (Boldface and uppercase omit-\nted). During the contested hearing to substantiate that alle-\ngation, the Department of Human Services (DHS) offered\nevidence that Levi provided petitioner\u2019s address for his\nemployment applications, car registration, financial records,\nas well as a note from petitioner\u2019s landlord. In that note,\npetitioner\u2019s landlord listed Levi as an occupant of the apart-\nment, but admitted that he was a \u201chands off\u201d landlord and\nthus was \u201cnot sure\u201d who was living in the apartment. He\nalso stated that he met the family through his ex-girlfriend\nbut, after that relationship ended in October 2018, he had\n\u201clost touch\u201d with petitioner and Levi.\n        Petitioner disputed that Levi resided with her full-\ntime. She testified that Levi lives elsewhere \u201cninety-five\npercent of the time\u201d and that he uses her address only for\nmailing purposes. Levi was not listed on the lease of the\napartment. And in his own application for SNAP benefits,\nLevi wrote that he lives at petitioner\u2019s residence only \u201cpart-\ntime\u201d and that he also lives in his car.\n         The ALJ concluded that petitioner committed an\nIPV because the \u201coverwhelming evidence in the record\ndemonstrate[d] that\u201d petitioner intentionally misrepre-\nsented her household income by not reporting that Levi lived\nwith her.2 On appeal, petitioner contends that neither sub-\nstantial evidence nor reason supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion.\n         We \u201cshall set aside or remand the order if [we] find[ ]\nthat the order is not supported by substantial evidence in\nthe record.

Notwithstanding\nthe fact that petitioner did not bear the burden of proof at the hearing, there was\nevidence in the record that the couple had lived separately due to domestic vio-\nlence, and petitioner testified that DHS told her to not list Levi on the application\nif she was experiencing domestic violence, out of concern for her safety.\n\fNonprecedential Memo Op: 339 Or App 170 (2025)                             173\n\n         We conclude that substantial evidence does not sup-\nport the finding that petitioner intentionally misrepresented\nher household composition. The ALJ relied exclusively on\nthe facts that Levi listed petitioner\u2019s address on various doc-\numents and that petitioner\u2019s landlord was aware that Levi\nwas at petitioner\u2019s apartment at some point during 2018 to\nconclude that there was \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d that peti-\ntioner misrepresented Levi\u2019s housing status. However, Levi\u2019s\nuse of the address is not on its own sufficient to prove by\nclear and convincing evidence that petitioner intentionally\nprovided false information on her applications, particularly\nwhen evidence in the record supports the contention that\nLevi lived in multiple places. The only other evidence sup-\nporting the ALJ\u2019s decision\u2014petitioner\u2019s landlord\u2019s note stat-\ning that Levi lived there\u2014also states that the landlord had\n\u201clost touch\u201d with petitioner and was unaware of who was\nin the apartment during most of the time period relevant\nto the hearing. Moreover, there was significant countervail-\ning evidence, including petitioner\u2019s testimony, the lease, and\nLevi\u2019s benefits applications.3 Accordingly, we conclude that\nthe ALJ\u2019s finding that DHS proved by clear and convinc-\ning evidence that petitioner intentionally misrepresented\nher household composition is not supported by substantial\nevidence. See Smithee v. Employment Dept., 228 Or App\n346, 350, 208 P3d 956 (2009) (concluding that substantial\nevidence did not support the ALJ\u2019s finding that claimant,\nwho undisputedly went over his break time, intentionally\nviolated a timekeeping regulation because there was coun-\ntervailing evidence that his employer allowed him to take\nunreported breaks and lacked a clear policy on work-break\nreporting).\n           Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n    3\n      Petitioner sought an extension of time, her first request, to obtain addi-\ntional evidence given that DHS had a year to prepare its case and her Oregon\nLaw Center attorney had less than three weeks to marshal evidence, and, addi-\ntionally, was scheduled to be out of the office during the hearing.

Property and Casualty Ins. Co. of Hartford\n\n            TOOKEY, P. J.\n         Plaintiffs Richard and Rita Griffith lost their home\nin a fire. They filed a claim with Hartford, their homeown-\ner\u2019s insurer. Hartford accepted the claim and made several\npayments and continued to adjust the claim. But plaintiffs\nbelieved that Hartford was not acting with sufficient alac-\nrity, and they retained attorney Vance. Vance filed a civil\naction against Hartford, alleging breach of contract, inten-\ntional infliction of emotional distress, and negligence, and\nseeking damages and prejudgment interest.\n         The complaint and Hartford\u2019s answer were the only\nfilings relating to Hartford in plaintiffs\u2019 civil action. Shortly\nthereafter, plaintiffs and Hartford executed a \u201cRelease and\nSettlement Agreement,\u201d under which the parties settled\nplaintiffs\u2019 insurance and breach of contract claims \u201cand\nall related controversies.\u201d Plaintiffs then filed a motion for\nsummary judgment in the proceeding, seeking prejudgment\ninterest from Hartford under ORS 82.010,1 on the theory\nthat the amount due on plaintiffs\u2019 insurance claim became\n\n     1\n       ORS 82.010 provides, in part:\n          \u201c(1) The rate of interest for the following transactions, if the parties have\n     not otherwise agreed to a rate of interest, is nine percent per annum and is\n     payable on:\n          \u201c(a) All moneys after they become due; but open accounts bear interest\n     from the date of the last item thereof.\n          \u201c(b) Money received to the use of another and retained beyond a reason-\n     able time without the owner\u2019s express or implied consent.\n          \u201c(c) Money due or to become due where there is a contract to pay interest\n     and no rate specified.\n          \u201c(2) Except as provided in this subsection, the rate of interest on judg-\n     ments for the payment of money is nine percent per annum. The following\n     apply as described:\n          \u201c(a) Interest on a judgment under this subsection accrues from the date\n     of the entry of the judgment unless the judgment specifies another date.\n          \u201c(b) Interest on a judgment under this subsection is simple interest,\n     unless otherwise provided by contract.\n          \u201c(c) Interest accruing from the date of the entry of a judgment shall also\n     accrue on interest that accrued before the date of entry of a judgment.\n          \u201c(d) Interest under this subsection shall also accrue on attorney fees and\n     costs entered as part of the judgment.\n          \u201c(e) A judgment on a contract bearing more than nine percent interest\n     shall bear interest at the same rate provided in the contract as of the date of\n     entry of the judgment.\u201d\n\fCite as 339 Or App 40 (2025)                                 43\n\nascertainable (and therefore \u201cdue\u201d) thirty days after the\nclaim was filed and that prejudgment interest was owed\nas provided in ORS 82.010(1), on \u201c[a]ll moneys after they\nbecome due.\u201d The trial court denied the motion, determin-\ning that it was premature, as there had been no judgment\nentered against Hartford.\n         Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their remaining\nclaims against Hartford. They then filed a petition for attor-\nney fees and costs and also refiled their motion for summary\njudgment seeking prejudgment interest. The trial court\nentered what was captioned a \u201csupplemental judgment,\u201d\ndenying plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on their\nrequest for prejudgment interest. In a limited judgment, the\ntrial court denied plaintiffs\u2019 request for costs but awarded\nplaintiffs their attorney fees of $221,179.27.\n         Plaintiffs appeal from the supplemental judgment,\nassigning error to the denial of their motion for summary\njudgment on their claim of prejudgment interest and appeal\nfrom a limited judgment denying costs. Hartford cross-\nappeals from the trial court\u2019s limited judgment awarding\nplaintiffs attorney fees, asserting that the trial court erro-\nneously awarded fees on a contingent or percentage-of-re-\ncovery basis. On plaintiffs\u2019 appeal of the supplemental judg-\nment denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment, we\nconclude that the supplemental judgment is not an appeal-\nable judgment and therefore dismiss the appeal; on plain-\ntiffs\u2019 appeal of the limited judgment, we conclude that the\ntrial court did not err or abuse its discretion in rejecting\nplaintiffs\u2019 request to recover their costs. On Hartford\u2019s cross-\nappeal of the limited judgment, we conclude that the trial\ncourt abused its discretion in determining that a fee based\non a contingency or a percentage of recovery\u2014rather than\nbased on hours worked\u2014was a reasonable fee, and, there-\nfore, reverse and remand for reconsideration of the limited\njudgment awarding fees.\n        In their first assignment of error, plaintiffs contend\nthat the trial court erred in denying their motion for sum-\nmary judgment on their claim for what they characterize\nas \u201cprejudgment interest.\u201d As noted, plaintiffs filed their\nmotion after they had reached a settlement with Hartford\n\f44   Griffith v. Property and Casualty Ins. Co. of Hartford\n\non their insurance claim and had fully released Hartford on\nthe breach of contract claims, which were the only claims\nthat could support an award of prejudgment interest, had a\njudgment been entered. But there was no general judgment\nand no limited monetary judgment for plaintiffs on either\nthe insurance claim or on plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract or\ntort claims. On the motion, the trial court entered a docu-\nment captioned \u201cSupplemental Judgment\u201d in which it stated\nthat the summary judgment was \u201cdenied.\u201d Plaintiffs con-\ntend that the trial court erred in denying their motion for\nsummary judgment, because the amount of interest owed to\nplaintiffs as of the date that Hartford should have paid pol-\nicy limits (which plaintiffs assert was within 30 days after\nplaintiffs\u2019 loss) was readily ascertainable, and prejudgment\ninterest was therefore awardable under ORS 82.010.\n         Hartford responds that the court\u2019s denial of the\nmotion is either not reviewable or was correct on its mer-\nits, because there is no basis for an award of prejudgment\ninterest in the absence of a judgment. Additionally, even\nassuming reviewability, Hartford asserts that the record as\nto plaintiffs\u2019 entitlement to prejudgment interest includes\ndisputed issues of material fact.\n        For several reasons, the trial court\u2019s ruling is not\nreviewable. First and foremost, the document captioned\n\u201cSupplemental Judgment,\u201d which simply denied plaintiffs\u2019\nmotion for summary judgment, is not an appealable judg-\nment. That is because it is not a proper supplemental judg-\nment, as no general judgment had been entered on plaintiffs\u2019\nbreach of contract claims. ORS 18.005(17) (A supplemental\njudgment is \u201ca judgment that may be rendered after a gen-\neral judgment pursuant to a legal authority.\u201d).\n         Secondly, even if the supplemental judgment were\nappealable, the denial of the motion for summary judg-\nment would not be reviewable. That is because, with limited\nexceptions, the denial of a motion for summary judgment\nis not reviewable on appeal. See Martin v. State of Oregon,\n331 Or App 225, 226 n 1, 545 P3d 776 (2024) (stating rule);\nFarnsworth v. Meadowland Ranches, Inc., 321 Or App 814,\n819, 519 P3d 153 (2022) (noting that \u201ca trial court\u2019s denial\nof summary judgment is generally unreviewable on appeal,\n\fCite as 339 Or App 40 (2025)                                               45\n\nwith limited exceptions,\u201d such as when the motion rests on\n\u201cpurely legal contentions\u201d). For example, in a case that has\ngone to trial, the denial of a summary judgment motion is\nsubject to review on appeal if the motion rested on a \u201cpurely\nlegal\u201d contention. Seidel v. Time Ins. Co., 157 Or App 556,\n560, 970 P2d 255 (1998). And when, for example, the appeal\narises from cross-motions for summary judgment, the grant-\ning of one motion and the denial of the other are both review-\nable. Eden Gate, Inc. v. D&L Excavating & Trucking, Inc.,\n178 Or App 610, 622, 37 P3d 233 (2002). This case does not\ninvolve either of those limited exceptions. Thus, we decline\nto address the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 challenge in their first\nassignment of error to the trial court\u2019s denial of their motion\nfor summary judgment seeking prejudgment interest.\n         In their second assignment of error, plaintiffs chal-\nlenge a limited judgment of the trial court declining to award\nthem costs on their claims against Hartford. Plaintiffs con-\ntend that, because attorney fees to which they are entitled\nunder ORS 742.061(1) are awarded \u201cas part of the costs of\nthe action,\u201d they are necessarily entitled to costs. We do not\nagree. ORCP 68 authorizes a court to award costs to a pre-\nvailing party. Having settled their contract claims against\nHartford and voluntarily dismissed their tort claims, we\nagree with Hartford that it was within the trial court\u2019s dis-\ncretion to determine whether plaintiffs prevailed in their\naction and were entitled to costs; the trial court did not\nabuse its discretion in determining that plaintiffs did not\nprevail in their action. See ORCP 54 A(3).2\n         We move on to Hartford\u2019s cross-appeal, in which\nHartford challenges the limited judgment awarding to\nplaintiffs attorney fees based on a percentage of plaintiffs\u2019\nrecovery rather than based on an hourly rate. What consti-\ntutes reasonable attorney fees is within the sound discre-\ntion of the court ordering the fee award. See ORS 20.075(3)\n(providing that \u201cthe decision of the court as to the amount\nof the award\u201d is reviewed for \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d). Hartford\n   2\n     ORCP 54 A(3)provides:\n       \u201cWhen an action is dismissed under this section, the judgment may\n   include any costs and disbursements, including attorney fees, provided by\n   contract, statute, or rule. Unless the circumstances indicate otherwise, the\n   dismissed party shall be considered the prevailing party.\u201d\n\f46      Griffith v. Property and Casualty Ins. Co. of Hartford\n\ndoes not dispute that plaintiffs were entitled to attorney fees\nunder ORS 742.061(1), which provides:\n     \u201c[I]f settlement is not made within six months from the\n     date proof of loss is filed with an insurer and an action is\n     brought in any court of this state upon any policy of insur-\n     ance of any kind or nature, and the plaintiff\u2019s recovery\n     exceeds the amount of any tender made by the defendant\n     in such action, a reasonable amount to be fixed by the court\n     as attorney fees shall be taxed as part of the costs of the\n     action and any appeal thereon.\u201d\n(Emphasis added.) Hartford acknowledges that plaintiffs\nwere entitled to attorney fees, because Hartford did not pay\nplaintiffs for the full loss within six months from the date\nof proof of loss. Hartford only disputes the basis on which\nthe trial court calculated the attorney fees and the amount\nawarded.\n         ORS 20.075 outlines a number of factors that the\ncourt must consider in setting a reasonable fee within its\ndiscretion, such as the time and labor required in the pro-\nceeding and the results obtained. Thoens v. Safeco Ins. Co.,\n317 Or App 727, 744, 507 P3d 284, adh\u2019d to as modified on\nrecons, 319 Or App 450, 508 P3d 1001 (2022) (\u201cA court has\nthe discretion to determine what amounts to a reasonable\nfee by considering the factors in ORS 20.075(1) and (2). ORS\n20.075(3) (providing that \u2018the decision of the court as to the\namount of the award\u2019 is reviewed for \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019)).\nHartford does not dispute that determining the amount\nof fees was within the trial court\u2019s discretion and that we\nreview that determination for an abuse of discretion. But\nHartford contends that, under the circumstances of this\ncase, the trial court abused its discretion in basing the fee\naward on a percentage of plaintiffs\u2019 recovery on their insur-\nance claim rather than on the \u201clodestar\u201d calculation\u2014a fee\nbased on an hourly rate. We agree with Hartford that, under\nthe circumstances here, the trial court abused its discretion\nin determining that a percentage of recovery was a reason-\nable basis on which calculate the amount of the attorney fee.\n        In any case in which an award of attorney fees is\nauthorized or required by statute, ORS 20.075(2) requires\nthe court to consider the factors in ORS 20.075(1) and\n\fCite as 339 Or App 40 (2025)                                      47\n\n20.075(2) in determining a reasonable amount of the fee. In\nFriends of Columbia Gorge v. Energy Fac. Siting Coun., 367\nOr 258, 267, 477 P3d 1191 (2020), the court stated,\n   \u201cThose factors are frequently captured by the \u2018lodestar\u2019\n   approach, under which a fee award is \u2018based on a reason-\n   able hourly rate, multiplied by a reasonable number of\n   hours devoted to work on the case, with certain adjust-\n   ments potentially made to that amount for factors such\n   as the risk of loss and the quality of the attorney\u2019s work.\u2019\n   Strawn[ v. Farmers Ins. Co., 353 Or 210, 217, 297 P3d 439\n   (2013)].\u201d\nIn contrast to the lodestar method, under which the fee is\ndetermined based on a reasonable hourly rate multiplied by\na reasonable number of hours devoted to work on the case,\nwith possible adjustments for factors such as the risk of loss\nand the quality of the attorney\u2019s work, the percent-of-recov-\nery method sets the fee by calculating the total recovery\nsecured by the attorney and awarding a reasonable per-\ncentage of that recovery. In general, the lodestar method\nis thought to more directly account for the amount of work\ndone; the percent-of-recovery method more directly reflects\nthe result achieved. Strawn, 353 Or at 219 (discussing the\ntwo approaches in the context of class-action claims involv-\ning fee-shifting statutes and common funds). The lodestar\nmethod is the prevailing method for determining the rea-\nsonableness of a fee award in cases, such as this, involv-\ning a statutory fee-shifting award, even when, as here, the\ninsured has retained counsel on a contingency-fee basis. Id.\nThe percentage-of-fund basis is a particularly appropriate\nmethod when there is a risk of recovery, when litigation has\nbeen extensive, or when the recovery involves a common\nfund from which attorney fees can be paid. See id. at 221.\n          Whichever method for the calculation of an award\nof fees is chosen, the amount awarded under ORS 742.061(1)\nmust be reasonable; a windfall award of attorney fees is to\nbe avoided. See ZRZ Realty v. Beneficial Fire and Casualty\nIns. Co., 255 Or App 524, 556-57, 300 P3d 1224 (2013) (The\n\u201cpotential for a windfall\u201d in an award of attorney fees \u201cis a\nfactor that the court can consider in setting a reasonable\nattorney fee.\u201d). Here, for the following reasons, we agree\nwith Hartford that the award the trial court made based on\n\f48    Griffith v. Property and Casualty Ins. Co. of Hartford\n\na percentage of plaintiffs\u2019 insurance recovery resulted in a\nwindfall that plaintiffs failed to establish was reasonable.\n          There was never a dispute or litigation as to\nHartford\u2019s liability for coverage of plaintiffs\u2019 insurance\nclaim; the claim was immediately accepted by Hartford, and\nwhen plaintiffs retained their attorney and filed this action,\nHartford had already made several payments and was con-\ntinuing to adjust the claim. And because, before plaintiffs\u2019\ncounsel was retained, the claim had not fully resolved within\nsix months of proof of loss, there was never doubt that an\nattorney retained by plaintiffs would be entitled to fees\nunder ORS 742.061(1), because Hartford had not made a\ntender of the full amount that it ultimately paid under the\npolicy. Because plaintiffs\u2019 counsel did not keep time records,\nthere is no evidence, other than filings, as to how much time\nhe spent on the case. Prior to the parties\u2019 settlement and\nrelease, there was minimal litigation by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\n(the filing of a complaint) with respect to plaintiffs\u2019 claims\nagainst Hartford. A delay in adjusting plaintiffs\u2019 claim was\ncaused by circumstances outside of the parties\u2019 control,\nincluding plaintiffs\u2019 remote location, winter weather, the dif-\nficulty locating a contractor to do cleanup, and the pandemic.\nBut there was never a risk that plaintiffs would not receive\nbenefits under the policy or that their attorney would not be\nentitled to a reasonable attorney fee under ORS 742.061(1).\nThe case was not complex. It did not involve a \u201ccommon fund,\u201d\nwhich might justify a fee based on the percentage of recov-\nery. See Strawn 353 Or at 217. And despite having agreed to\ndo so in his fee agreement with plaintiffs, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\ndid not keep or provide time records of the hours spent on the\nclaim against Hartford, against which the trial court could\nhave evaluated whether the lodestar method would be suffi-\ncient to reasonably compensate plaintiffs\u2019 counsel.\n         Plaintiffs, as the party seeking an award of fees,\nhad the burden of establishing the reasonableness of the fee\namount under either method. Hillsboro v. Maint. & Const.\nServ., 269 Or 169, 172, 523 P2d 1036 (1974) (where oppos-\ning party objects to attorney fee request, burden of proving\nreasonableness of fees rests on party seeking them). In light\nof the above-described circumstances, we conclude that the\n\fCite as 339 Or App 40 (2025)                               49\n\nrecord does not permit a conclusion that plaintiffs estab-\nlished the reasonableness of a fee award based on a percent-\nage of recovery, and that it was therefore an abuse of discre-\ntion by the trial court to determine that plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\nshould receive a fee under ORS 742.061(1) as a percentage of\nplaintiffs\u2019 recovery under the policy rather than under the\nlodestar method. We therefore reverse the award of attorney\nfees in the limited judgment and remand for reconsideration\nof the fee award.\n         On appeal of limited judgment, denial of costs\naffirmed; on appeal of supplemental judgment, appeal dis-\nmissed; on cross-appeal, limited judgment awarding attor-\nney fees reversed and remanded.\n\f",

United States, 582 US 357, 364-65, 137 S Ct\n1958, 198 L Ed 2d 476 (2017) (holding that, under the Sixth\n\fNonprecedential Memo Op: 339 Or App 158 (2025)           163\n\nAmendment to the United States Constitution, \u201cwhen a\ndefendant claims that his counsel\u2019s deficient performance\ndeprived him of a trial by causing him to accept a plea, the\ndefendant can show prejudice by demonstrating a reason-\nable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not\nhave pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to\ntrial\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n         That is, the evidence that trial counsel could have\nobtained was unlikely to have changed the outcome of a\ntrial. See Saroian v. State of Oregon, 154 Or App 112, 118,\n961 P2d 252 (1998) (\u201c[W]here the alleged error of counsel is\na failure to investigate or discover potentially exculpatory\nevidence, the determination whether the error \u2018prejudiced\u2019\nthe defendant by causing him to plead guilty rather than go\nto trial will depend on the likelihood that discovery of the\nevidence would have led counsel to change his recommenda-\ntion as to the plea. This assessment, in turn, will depend in\nlarge part on a prediction whether the evidence would have\nchanged the outcome of a trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks\nand emphases omitted.)). And the record supports the post-\nconviction court\u2019s implicit finding that the evidence that\npetitioner contends trial counsel should have discovered\nwith reasonable investigation would not have resulted in a\nbetter plea offer from the state.

And at that hearing, petitioner confirmed to\nthe trial court that she \u201cread the plea petition [or] had it\ntranslated into her native language,\u201d that she \u201cunder[stood]\nthe plea petition,\u201d that she had \u201can adequate opportunity\nto review the plea petition, * * * court processes, and [her]\ndecision to enter a guilty plea with [her] attorney,\u201d and that\nshe \u201cunderstood what it is [she] was doing by pleading guilty\nto two counts of assault in the second degree.\u201d She also con-\nfirmed that she did not \u201cneed more time to speak\u201d with her\nattorney before the court accepted her guilty pleas and that\nshe was \u201cin fact guilty of two counts of assault in the sec-\nond degree as domestic violence offenses.\u201d Based on those\nresponses, the trial court accepted petitioner\u2019s guilty plea.\n         Finally, petitioner did not produce evidence that she\nwas confused about any of the specific rights that she was\nwaiving by entering a plea or about the specific terms of\nthe plea itself. See Wilson v. Armenakis, 144 Or App 587,\n589, 928 P2d 354 (1996), rev den, 324 Or 560 (1997) (reject-\ning post-conviction petitioner\u2019s claim that his plea was not\nknowing and voluntary, where post-conviction court found\nthat the \u201cpetitioner executed a plea petition that set out the\nrights that he was waiving,\u201d that \u201ctrial counsel read the peti-\ntion to petitioner before he entered his guilty plea,\u201d and that,\n\u201cbefore accepting the plea, the trial court assured itself that\npetitioner\u2019s plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent\u201d).\n        Affirmed.\n\f",

We affirm.\n           We review the grant of an ORCP 21 motion to dis-\nmiss for legal error, Hernandez v. Catholic Health Initiatives,\n311 Or App 70, 72, 490 P3d 166 (2021), assuming \u201cthat all\nwell-pleaded facts are true and giv[ing] plaintiff the bene-\nfit of all favorable inferences that reasonably may be drawn\nfrom those factual allegations,\u201d Piazza v. Kellim, 360 Or 58,\n61, 377 P3d 492 (2016).1\n          Plaintiff entered Mt. Tabor Park, a city park owned\nby defendant, to recreate and \u201cwalk its trails.\u201d While walk-\ning on a paved road toward the exit of the park, plain-\ntiff stepped into a hole in the pavement and was severely\ninjured. Plaintiff sued defendant for negligence, and defen-\ndant moved to dismiss on the ground that, based on plain-\ntiff\u2019s complaint, the affirmative defense of recreational use\nimmunity applied and barred plaintiff\u2019s claim. See ORS\n105.682 (limiting liability of owner of land for certain inju-\nries that arise out of recreational use).2 The trial court\nagreed with defendant and dismissed plaintiff\u2019s complaint\nwith prejudice and denied her motion to replead, reasoning\n    1\n      The parties do not address, and we do not decide, whether ORCP 21 A is the\ncorrect procedural vehicle for the affirmative defense of recreational use immu-\nnity. Compare ORCP 21 A(1) (listing enumerated defenses available in motion to\ndismiss) with ORCP 19 B (listing defenses that a party \u201cshall\u201d plead, including\n\u201cany other matter constituting an * * * affirmative defense).\n    2\n      The recreational use immunity statute, ORS 105.682, in relevant part, pro-\nvides that:\n    \u201can owner of land is not liable in contract or tort for any personal injury,\n    death or property damage that arises out of the use of the land for recre-\n    ational purposes * * * when the owner of land either directly or indirectly\n    permits any person to use the land for recreational purposes * * *. The limita-\n    tion on liability provided by this section applies if the principal purpose for\n    entry upon the land is for recreational purposes * * * and is not affected if the\n    injury, death or damage occurs while the person entering land is engaging in\n    activities other than the use of the land for recreational purposes[.]\u201d\n\f102                                 Laxer v. City of Portland\n\nthat any amendment would be futile. On appeal, plaintiff\nasserts that the trial court erred in ruling that recreational\nuse immunity applied and in denying plaintiff the opportu-\nnity to replead her complaint.\n         First Assignment of Error. Plaintiff first assigns\nerror to the trial court\u2019s grant of defendant\u2019s motion to dis-\nmiss on the ground that recreational use immunity applied.\nOn appeal, plaintiff asserts three arguments: (1) defen-\ndant\u2019s affirmative actions in paving the roads and walk-\nways in Mt. Tabor and representing to the public that those\nroads and walkways were \u201caccessible\u201d constitute intentional\nconduct which renders recreational use immunity unavail-\nable to defendant, ORS 105.682(2) (\u201cThis section does not\nlimit the liability of an owner of land for intentional injury\nor damage.\u201d); (2) the elements of recreational use immunity\nwere not met, because plaintiff was not engaged in a recre-\national purpose at the time of her injury; and (3) the roads\nand paths of Mt. Tabor are like a public sidewalk\u2014which\nfall outside the scope of recreational immunity, because\nthey are used by the public for various purposes. See Landis\nv. Limbaugh, 282 Or App 284, 294, 385 P3d 1139 (2016),\nrev dismissed, 361 Or 351 (2017) (recreational use immunity\nunavailable to defendant for injury that occurred on regular\npedestrian sidewalk).\n         We do not address plaintiff\u2019s first argument, as it is\nunpreserved. See Summit RWP, Inc. v. Hallin, 334 Or App\n529, 535, 557 P3d 1113 (2024) (generally we will not consider\nargument based on new theory for the first time on appeal);\nJohn Hyland Const., Inc. v. Williamsen & Bleid, Inc., 287\nOr App 466, 471, 402 P3d 719 (2017) (\u201c[T]he purpose of an\nappeal is not to give the appellant an opportunity to pursue\na new theory that it did not rely on below.\u201d). And, assuming\nthat plaintiff\u2019s second argument is preserved, it is foreclosed\nby the text of the recreational use immunity statute and con-\ntrolling case law. Coleman v. Oregon Parks and Recreation\nDept., 347 Or 94, 102, 217 P3d 651 (2009) (noting that rec-\nreational use immunity extends \u201cas long as the injured per-\nson\u2019s principal purpose for entry is recreational, even if the\nperson was engaged in other nonrecreational activity at the\ntime of injury\u201d (citing ORS 105.682(1))).\n\fCite as 339 Or App 100 (2025)                                 103\n\nPlaintiff\u2019s last argument, as we understand it, is that (1) the\npaved walkways in Mt. Tabor are like the paved sidewalks\nto which recreational immunity did not apply in Landis and\n(2) the application of recreational immunity to some inju-\nries and not others would produce irrational results that we\nsought to avoid in Landis. 282 Or App at 295.\nPlaintiff extends Landis too far: although we held there that\ncertain kinds of generally available public land, like side-\nwalks, would be outside the scope of recreational use immu-\nnity, we expressly noted that some generally available land\nconnected with recreation would still be subject to immunity:\n   \u201cNowhere in legislative history do we find any suggestion\n   that recreational immunity would apply to streets or side-\n   walks that are already generally available to the public,\n   that are not attendant to parks or places of recreation, and\n   that the landowner has done nothing to \u2018make available\u2019 for\n   the statutorily specified recreational or similar uses.\u201d\nId. at 294 (emphasis added); see also Waggoner v. City of\nWoodburn, 196 Or App 715, 717, 103 P3d 648 (2004) (recre-\national use immunity applies to public city parks).\n          Lastly, we address a new, unbriefed argument,\nbrought up by plaintiff at oral argument for the first time,\nthat the location where plaintiff was injured\u2014a paved\naccess road within Mt. Tabor Park\u2014makes recreational use\nimmunity inapplicable to defendant. See ORS 105.688(1)(c)\n(2021), amended by Or Laws 2024, ch 64 \u00a7 7 (recreational\nuse immunity applies to \u201c[a]ll paths, trails, roads, * * * and\nother rights of way\u201d used to access land to recreate \u201cthat\nhave not been improved, designed or maintained for the spe-\ncific purpose of providing access for recreational purposes\u201d).\nThat new argument relies on Fields v. City of Newport, 326\nOr App 764, 533 P3d 384, rev den, 371 Or 476 (2023), in\nwhich we concluded that recreational use immunity would\nnot apply to a paved beach access trail used solely for access\nto the beach. Id. at 775. Although we are under no obligation\nto address that argument, we observe that it is foreclosed by\nour recent decision in Murphy v. City of Cannon Beach, 338\nOr App 104, 106-08, 108 n 2, ___ P3d ___ (2025) (holding\nthat ORS 105.688(1)(c) (2021) \u201cis relevant only where a plain-\ntiff is injured on land adjacent to the land that the person\n\f104                                Laxer v. City of Portland\n\nintends to use for recreational purposes\u201d (emphasis added)),\nand we decline to address it further, see ORAP 6.15(6) (\u201cIt\nis the general policy of Oregon appellate courts to prohibit\nreference at oral argument to any authority not cited either\nin a brief or in a pre-argument memorandum of additional\nauthorities.\u201d).\n          Second Assignment of Error. Plaintiff next contends\nthat the trial court erred by denying leave to amend her\ncomplaint. Plaintiff requested leave to amend \u201cin order to\nmore fully allege her purpose for being on the walkway in\nMt. Tabor, and to more fully articulate her position that the\nCity\u2019s affirmative acts and conduct were such that [plain-\ntiff] relied on the City\u2019s representations to her detriment.\u201d\n         We review a court\u2019s denial of leave to amend after\nan ORCP 21 A dismissal for an abuse of discretion. Caldeen\nConstruction v. Kemp, 248 Or App 82, 86, 273 P3d 174 (2012).\nA trial court\u2019s discretion to grant or deny motions to amend\na complaint after a motion to dismiss is not limitless; it is\nbounded by the requirement that motions to amend should\nbe liberally granted if amendment would preclude the entry\nof a judgment. Id.

Tabor Park, a city park owned\nby defendant, to recreate and \u201cwalk its trails.\u201d While walk-\ning on a paved road toward the exit of the park, plain-\ntiff stepped into a hole in the pavement and was severely\ninjured. Plaintiff sued defendant for negligence, and defen-\ndant moved to dismiss on the ground that, based on plain-\ntiff\u2019s complaint, the affirmative defense of recreational use\nimmunity applied and barred plaintiff\u2019s claim. See ORS\n105.682 (limiting liability of owner of land for certain inju-\nries that arise out of recreational use).2 The trial court\nagreed with defendant and dismissed plaintiff\u2019s complaint\nwith prejudice and denied her motion to replead, reasoning\n    1\n      The parties do not address, and we do not decide, whether ORCP 21 A is the\ncorrect procedural vehicle for the affirmative defense of recreational use immu-\nnity. Compare ORCP 21 A(1) (listing enumerated defenses available in motion to\ndismiss) with ORCP 19 B (listing defenses that a party \u201cshall\u201d plead, including\n\u201cany other matter constituting an * * * affirmative defense).\n    2\n      The recreational use immunity statute, ORS 105.682, in relevant part, pro-\nvides that:\n    \u201can owner of land is not liable in contract or tort for any personal injury,\n    death or property damage that arises out of the use of the land for recre-\n    ational purposes * * * when the owner of land either directly or indirectly\n    permits any person to use the land for recreational purposes * * *. The limita-\n    tion on liability provided by this section applies if the principal purpose for\n    entry upon the land is for recreational purposes * * * and is not affected if the\n    injury, death or damage occurs while the person entering land is engaging in\n    activities other than the use of the land for recreational purposes[.]\u201d\n\f102                                 Laxer v. City of Portland\n\nthat any amendment would be futile. On appeal, plaintiff\nasserts that the trial court erred in ruling that recreational\nuse immunity applied and in denying plaintiff the opportu-\nnity to replead her complaint.\n         First Assignment of Error. Plaintiff first assigns\nerror to the trial court\u2019s grant of defendant\u2019s motion to dis-\nmiss on the ground that recreational use immunity applied.\nOn appeal, plaintiff asserts three arguments: (1) defen-\ndant\u2019s affirmative actions in paving the roads and walk-\nways in Mt. Tabor and representing to the public that those\nroads and walkways were \u201caccessible\u201d constitute intentional\nconduct which renders recreational use immunity unavail-\nable to defendant, ORS 105.682(2) (\u201cThis section does not\nlimit the liability of an owner of land for intentional injury\nor damage.\u201d); (2) the elements of recreational use immunity\nwere not met, because plaintiff was not engaged in a recre-\national purpose at the time of her injury; and (3) the roads\nand paths of Mt. Tabor are like a public sidewalk\u2014which\nfall outside the scope of recreational immunity, because\nthey are used by the public for various purposes. See Landis\nv.

J.\n         Petitioner appeals a judgment denying his petition\nfor post-conviction relief from convictions for aggravated\nmurder with a firearm, attempted aggravated murder with\na firearm, first-degree assault with a firearm, second-degree\nassault with a firearm, and one count of unlawful use of a\nweapon. Petitioner was represented by a team of two attor-\nneys at trial. He alleges that his criminal trial counsel were\nconstitutionally inadequate and ineffective in a variety of\nrespects, and that the post-conviction court erred in deny-\ning relief on the alleged grounds of inadequacy and inef-\nfectiveness. We review the post-conviction court\u2019s denial of\npost-conviction relief for legal error, accepting the court\u2019s\nsupported implicit and explicit factual findings. Green v.\nFranke, 357 Or 301, 312, 350 P3d 188 (2015). Reviewing\nunder those standards, we affirm.\n          Legal Standards. At issue in this matter are par-\nallel claims of inadequate assistance of trial counsel under\nArticle I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution, and ineffec-\ntive assistance of trial counsel under the Sixth Amendment\nto the United States Constitution. To establish that his trial\ncounsel rendered inadequate assistance for purposes of\nArticle I, section 11, petitioner was required to prove two ele-\nments: (1) a performance element\u2014that trial counsel \u201cfailed\nto exercise reasonable professional skill and judgment\u201d; and\n(2) a prejudice element\u2014that \u201cpetitioner suffered prejudice\nas a result of counsel\u2019s inadequacy.\u201d Johnson v. Premo, 361\nOr 688, 699, 399 P3d 431 (2017). A functionally equivalent\ntwo-element standard governs petitioner\u2019s claim of ineffec-\ntive assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment. Id.\nTo prevail on that claim, petitioner was required to demon-\nstrate that \u201ctrial counsel\u2019s performance \u2018fell below an objec-\ntive standard of reasonableness\u2019 \u201d and also that \u201cthere was a\n\u2018reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional\nerrors, the result of the proceeding would have been differ-\nent.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 700 (quoting Strickland v. Washington, 466 US\n668, 694, 104 S Ct 2052, 80 L Ed 2d 674 (1984)).\n        Failure to File Motion to Suppress. In his first\nassignment of error, which is the only assignment of error\nasserted in the brief filed by counsel, petitioner contends\n\fNonprecedential Memo Op: 339 Or App 151 (2025)           153\n\nthat the post-conviction court erred by denying relief on his\nclaim that his trial counsel were inadequate and ineffective\nfor not moving to suppress statements that he made in a\npost-arrest interview. In denying relief, the post-conviction\ncourt credited petitioner\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s explanation as to\nwhy they did not move to suppress\u2014that parts of the inter-\nview would support petitioner\u2019s trial strategy of claiming\nself-defense, and that they did not have a basis to move\nto suppress the statements that petitioner made before he\nclearly invoked his Miranda rights. On this record, as the\npost-conviction court correctly concluded, neither of those\nassessments represents a failure to exercise reasonable pro-\nfessional skill and judgment.\n          It was not unreasonable for petitioner\u2019s trial coun-\nsel to think that the statements could buttress petition-\ner\u2019s self-defense strategy. Trial counsel reasoned that one\nof petitioner\u2019s statements in the interview\u2014\u201dthey go on\nme\u201d\u2014was consistent with his claim of self-defense and was\nimportant because of its timing. Because petitioner made it\nto the police soon after the shooting, it could demonstrate\nthat petitioner had not changed his story after the fact.\n          It also was not unreasonable for petitioner\u2019s trial\ncounsel to think that a motion to suppress would not have\nsucceeded. Although petitioner contends that reasonable\ncounsel would have argued that petitioner\u2019s statement that\n\u201cI don\u2019t know nothin\u2019 about nothin\u2019 \u201d was an invocation of his\nMiranda right to remain silent, on its face, the statement is\na disclaimer of knowledge that does not state or imply that\npetitioner did not want to talk to police. It therefore stands\nin stark contrast with the statements that the Supreme\nCourt and we have deemed to be unequivocal or equivocal\ninvocations of the Miranda right to remain silent, which\ncontain some reference to speaking. See State v. Nichols,\n361 Or 101, 104, 107, 390 P3d 1001 (2017) (concluding that\n\u201cit\u2019s not something I want to talk about\u201d was an unequivo-\ncal invocation of the right to remain silent); State v. Rose,\n296 Or App 99, 102, 108, 437 P3d 1144 (2019) (concluding\nthat \u201cI don\u2019t have nothing to say\u201d was an equivocal invo-\ncation). Given that contrast, petitioners\u2019 trial counsel rea-\nsonably could conclude that petitioner\u2019s statement, \u201cI don\u2019t\n\f154                                      Richardson v. Cain\n\nknow nothin\u2019 about nothin\u2019,\u201d would not support a motion to\nsuppress premised on the theory that the statement invoked\npetitioner\u2019s Miranda rights and reasonably decline to pur-\nsue such a motion.\n         Failure to Seek Exclusion of Evidence That the Gun\nWas Stolen. In his first pro se supplemental assignment,\npetitioner contends that trial counsel were inadequate and\nineffective for not moving in limine to exclude evidence that\nthe gun that petitioner used to shoot the victims was stolen.\nThe post-conviction court denied relief on this claim for a\nrange of reasons, including that petitioner did not demon-\nstrate that the inclusion of the evidence prejudiced him:\n\u201cPetitioner did not prove that the introduction of evidence\nthat [p]etitioner had stolen the gun used in the shooting\ncould have had a tendency to affect the outcome of the trial.\u201d\nOn review of the record, we agree with that conclusion.\nGiven the evidence of petitioner\u2019s conduct, and the minimal\nemphasis placed on how petitioner acquired the gun, it is\nunlikely that the evidence had any tendency to affect the\njury\u2019s decision.\n         Failure to Call Memory Expert. In his second pro\nse supplemental assignment, petitioner contends that his\ntrial counsel were inadequate and ineffective for not calling\na memory expert as a witness at trial to explain petition-\ner\u2019s trial testimony that he did not remember pulling out\nhis gun, pulling the trigger, or shooting anyone. The post-\nconviction court denied relief on this claim based on its fac-\ntual findings that petitioner had not told his attorneys that\nhe did not remember his conduct, and, on multiple occasions,\ngave detailed descriptions of the events leading to the shoot-\nings. This led the post-conviction court to the conclusion\nthat trial counsel had no reason to foresee the need for a\nmemory expert. Those findings are supported by the record\nand preclude the conclusion that counsel\u2019s omission to call a\nmemory expert represents a failure to exercise reasonable\nprofessional skill and judgment. Green, 357 Or at 312 (sup-\nported findings of fact binding on appellate court). Absent\nevidence that petitioner had memory issues as counsel pre-\npared for trial, there was no reason for counsel to consult a\nmemory expert.\n\fNonprecedential Memo Op: 339 Or App 151 (2025)             155\n\n         Failure to Call Self-Defense Expert. In his third pro\nse supplemental assignment, petitioner assigns error to the\npost-conviction court\u2019s denial of relief on his claim that coun-\nsel were inadequate and ineffective for not calling as a wit-\nness Bedard, an expert they had hired to support petition-\ner\u2019s claim of self-defense. Counsel hired Bedard to observe\npetitioner\u2019s testimony at trial and then provide expert tes-\ntimony as to how it was consistent with self-defense. After\npetitioner testified at trial that he did not remember pulling\nthe trigger or shooting people, the trial court imposed sig-\nnificant limitations on Bedard\u2019s potential testimony, includ-\ning prohibiting him from opining on self-defense or on peti-\ntioner\u2019s response to the situation he was in. It was under\nthose circumstances that counsel decided not to call Bedard\nand so trial counsels\u2019 decision was a reasonable one because,\ngiven the trial court\u2019s limitations, the testimony would have\ndone little, if anything, to advance the defense.\n        Petitioner also contends that trial counsel failed to\nproperly prepare Bedard for trial. But as the superintendent\npoints out, that particular claim is not preserved. Beyond\nthat, we note that it is not clear what counsel could have\ndone to prepare Bedard for trial, given the substantial and\nunanticipated change in petitioner\u2019s story once he took the\nstand.\n         Failure to Adequately Advise Petitioner. In his\nfourth pro se supplemental assignment, petitioner assigns\nerror the post-conviction court\u2019s denial of relief on his claim\nthat trial counsel were inadequate and ineffective in advis-\ning him regarding the possibility of the death penalty and\npotential issues of appeal. Petitioner asserts that counsels\u2019\ninadequate advice prejudiced him by causing him to waive\nhis right to appeal and stipulate to a sentence of life without\nparole, when he otherwise would not have agreed to stipu-\nlate.

In his first\nassignment of error, which is the only assignment of error\nasserted in the brief filed by counsel, petitioner contends\n\fNonprecedential Memo Op: </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">339 Or App 151</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2025)           153\n\nthat the post-conviction court erred by denying relief on his\nclaim that his trial counsel were inadequate and ineffective\nfor not moving to suppress statements that he made in a\npost-arrest interview. In denying relief, the post-conviction\ncourt credited petitioner\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s explanation as to\nwhy they did not move to suppress\u2014that parts of the inter-\nview would support petitioner\u2019s trial strategy of claiming\nself-defense, and that they did not have a basis to move\nto suppress the statements that petitioner made before he\nclearly invoked his Miranda rights. On this record, as the\npost-conviction court correctly concluded, neither of those\nassessments represents a failure to exercise reasonable pro-\nfessional skill and judgment.\n          It was not unreasonable for petitioner\u2019s trial coun-\nsel to think that the statements could buttress petition-\ner\u2019s self-defense strategy. Trial counsel reasoned that one\nof petitioner\u2019s statements in the interview\u2014\u201dthey go on\nme\u201d\u2014was consistent with his claim of self-defense and was\nimportant because of its timing. Because petitioner made it\nto the police soon after the shooting, it could demonstrate\nthat petitioner had not changed his story after the fact.\n          It also was not unreasonable for petitioner\u2019s trial\ncounsel to think that a motion to suppress would not have\nsucceeded. Although petitioner contends that reasonable\ncounsel would have argued that petitioner\u2019s statement that\n\u201cI don\u2019t know nothin\u2019 about nothin\u2019 \u201d was an invocation of his\nMiranda right to remain silent, on its face, the statement is\na disclaimer of knowledge that does not state or imply that\npetitioner did not want to talk to police. It therefore stands\nin stark contrast with the statements that the Supreme\nCourt and we have deemed to be unequivocal or equivocal\ninvocations of the Miranda right to remain silent, which\ncontain some reference to speaking.

Given that contrast, petitioners\u2019 trial counsel rea-\nsonably could conclude that petitioner\u2019s statement, \u201cI don\u2019t\n\f154                                      Richardson v. Cain\n\nknow nothin\u2019 about nothin\u2019,\u201d would not support a motion to\nsuppress premised on the theory that the statement invoked\npetitioner\u2019s Miranda rights and reasonably decline to pur-\nsue such a motion.\n         Failure to Seek Exclusion of Evidence That the Gun\nWas Stolen. In his first pro se supplemental assignment,\npetitioner contends that trial counsel were inadequate and\nineffective for not moving in limine to exclude evidence that\nthe gun that petitioner used to shoot the victims was stolen.\nThe post-conviction court denied relief on this claim for a\nrange of reasons, including that petitioner did not demon-\nstrate that the inclusion of the evidence prejudiced him:\n\u201cPetitioner did not prove that the introduction of evidence\nthat [p]etitioner had stolen the gun used in the shooting\ncould have had a tendency to affect the outcome of the trial.\u201d\nOn review of the record, we agree with that conclusion.\nGiven the evidence of petitioner\u2019s conduct, and the minimal\nemphasis placed on how petitioner acquired the gun, it is\nunlikely that the evidence had any tendency to affect the\njury\u2019s decision.\n         Failure to Call Memory Expert. In his second pro\nse supplemental assignment, petitioner contends that his\ntrial counsel were inadequate and ineffective for not calling\na memory expert as a witness at trial to explain petition-\ner\u2019s trial testimony that he did not remember pulling out\nhis gun, pulling the trigger, or shooting anyone. The post-\nconviction court denied relief on this claim based on its fac-\ntual findings that petitioner had not told his attorneys that\nhe did not remember his conduct, and, on multiple occasions,\ngave detailed descriptions of the events leading to the shoot-\nings. This led the post-conviction court to the conclusion\nthat trial counsel had no reason to foresee the need for a\nmemory expert. Those findings are supported by the record\nand preclude the conclusion that counsel\u2019s omission to call a\nmemory expert represents a failure to exercise reasonable\nprofessional skill and judgment.

In his third pro\nse supplemental assignment, petitioner assigns error to the\npost-conviction court\u2019s denial of relief on his claim that coun-\nsel were inadequate and ineffective for not calling as a wit-\nness Bedard, an expert they had hired to support petition-\ner\u2019s claim of self-defense. Counsel hired Bedard to observe\npetitioner\u2019s testimony at trial and then provide expert tes-\ntimony as to how it was consistent with self-defense. After\npetitioner testified at trial that he did not remember pulling\nthe trigger or shooting people, the trial court imposed sig-\nnificant limitations on Bedard\u2019s potential testimony, includ-\ning prohibiting him from opining on self-defense or on peti-\ntioner\u2019s response to the situation he was in. It was under\nthose circumstances that counsel decided not to call Bedard\nand so trial counsels\u2019 decision was a reasonable one because,\ngiven the trial court\u2019s limitations, the testimony would have\ndone little, if anything, to advance the defense.\n        Petitioner also contends that trial counsel failed to\nproperly prepare Bedard for trial. But as the superintendent\npoints out, that particular claim is not preserved. Beyond\nthat, we note that it is not clear what counsel could have\ndone to prepare Bedard for trial, given the substantial and\nunanticipated change in petitioner\u2019s story once he took the\nstand.\n         Failure to Adequately Advise Petitioner. In his\nfourth pro se supplemental assignment, petitioner assigns\nerror the post-conviction court\u2019s denial of relief on his claim\nthat trial counsel were inadequate and ineffective in advis-\ning him regarding the possibility of the death penalty and\npotential issues of appeal. Petitioner asserts that counsels\u2019\ninadequate advice prejudiced him by causing him to waive\nhis right to appeal and stipulate to a sentence of life without\nparole, when he otherwise would not have agreed to stipu-\nlate. The post-conviction court denied relief on this claim,\nexplaining its reasoning in detail, and finding that peti-\ntioner was advised extensively on the \u201cpluses and minuses\nof the resolution and the effect of waiving appeal.\u201d The post-\nconviction court further found that \u201cThere were no sure-fire\nissues on appeal and [p]etitioner was advised of his chances\non appeal.\u201d\n\f156                                       Richardson v. Cain\n\n         In challenging that ruling on appeal, petitioner\ndoes not dispute the post-conviction court\u2019s factual find-\nings, meaningfully engage with its reasoning, or point to\nany evidence in the record that would compel the court to\nconclude that petitioner met the burden of demonstrating\nthat the advice he received was mistaken or unreasonable.\nHowever, petitioner identifies three issues that he claims\n\u201ccould have been raised on direct appeal\u201d: a Batson issue; a\nmistrial issue; and an issue regarding the limitations that\nthe trial court placed on Bedard\u2019s potential testimony.

J.\n         Youth appeals a juvenile court order requiring him\nto report as a sex offender. He assigns error to the order\nitself and argues that the court applied an erroneous legal\nstandard in assessing whether he met his burden to prove\n\u201cby clear and convincing evidence that [he] is rehabilitated\nand does not pose a threat to the safety of the public,\u201d ORS\n163A.030(7)(b), because the court did not focus on youth\u2019s\ncurrent risk of sexual recidivism. Additionally, youth assigns\nerror to the court\u2019s exclusion of (1) an article about juvenile\nsexual recidivism (the Caldwell article1), (2) an article about\nthe effectiveness of specialized treatment programs for\njuvenile sex offenders (the Kettrey article2), and (3) youth\u2019s\noriginal treatment notebook. Youth argues that his expert\nrelied upon the research articles in her direct and rebuttal\ntestimony and that they were, thus, relevant to her credibil-\nity and conclusions. He argues that the original notebook\nwas relevant because it would allow him to rebut allegations\nthat he had forged certain initials in the notebook and that\nhe provided incomplete copies of the notebook to his benefit.\nAccording to youth, exclusion of the relevant exhibits was\nreversible error.\n         The state does not dispute that the excluded exhib-\nits are relevant. It argues instead that the exhibits were\nproperly excluded as a discretionary sanction for discovery\nviolations. Youth argues that the juvenile court abused its\ndiscretion when it excluded the exhibits because, under ORS\n163A.030(9), the statutory hearing is designed to allow the\njuvenile court to \u201creceive testimony, reports and other evi-\ndence, without regard to whether the evidence is admissible\nunder\u201d the rules of evidence if it is \u201crelated to the determi-\nnation and findings required under\u201d ORS 163A.030.\n        We conclude, for the reasons that follow, that the\nCaldwell and Kettrey articles, and the original treatment\nnotebook, were relevant to the issues before the juvenile\n\n   1\n      Michael F.

With respect to the merits of the court\u2019s decision\nordering youth to report as a sex offender, we conclude that\nthe record did not require it to answer the factual ques-\ntion under ORS 163A.030 in a different way. We, therefore,\naffirm.\n         Youth asks us to conduct de novo review. ORS\n19.415(3)(b) permits us, in our \u201csole discretion,\u201d to \u201ctry the\ncause anew upon the record or [to] make one or more factual\nfindings anew upon the record.\u201d ORAP 5.40(8) describes the\nprocess by which de novo review may be requested, and it\nprovides a nonexclusive and nonbinding list of items that\nwe consider relevant to the decision whether to exercise our\ndiscretion to conduct de novo review, emphasizing that we\nexercise our discretion to conduct de novo review only in\n\u201cexceptional cases.\u201d\n         We recently exercised our discretion to review the\nrecord de novo in two appeals of orders requiring sex offender\nreporting: State v. X. E. W., 331 Or App 1, 2, 546 P3d 288\n(2024) (exercising authority to review the record de novo \u201cin\norder to apply the legal principles outlined in State v. A. R.\nH., 371 Or 82, 530 P3d 897 (2023), which the Supreme Court\nissued after the parties submitted their briefs in this case\u201d)\nand State v. K. L. F., 333 Or App 434, 435, 552 P3d 722\n(2024) (exercising authority to review the record de novo, \u201c[a]\ns we recently did\u201d in X. E. W. because \u201cthe juvenile court\napplied an incorrect standard when assessing youth\u2019s risk\nof recidivism\u201d). This case is similar to both X. E. W. and K.\nL. F. in that the juvenile court ruled on youth\u2019s petition for\nrelief from sex offender requirements before A. R. H. was\npublished. However, this case does not present the same\nconcerns that were present in X. E. W. and K. L. F. about\nthe trial court\u2019s application of the correct legal framework.\nConsequently, we do not exercise our discretion to review\nthis case de novo.\n        We conduct our review of the juvenile court\u2019s order\nrequiring youth to report as a sex offender in accordance\nwith the usual standard of appellate review, recogniz-\ning that the juvenile court\u2019s assigned inquiry under ORS\n\fCite as 339 Or App 134 (2025)                                              137\n\n163A.030(7)(b) is \u201ca factual inquiry.\u201d A. R.

We\nreview the juvenile court\u2019s exclusion of relevant evidence as\nduplicative for abuse of discretion. See State v. Titus, 328 Or\n475, 481, 982 P2d 1133 (1999) (\u201cA decision to exclude evi-\ndence under OEC 403 is reserved to the trial court\u2019s discre-\ntion.\u201d). We conduct our review of the juvenile court\u2019s eviden-\ntiary rulings \u201cin light of the record that was before the court\nat the time of its ruling.\u201d State v. Rodriguez-Delao, 335 Or\nApp 700, 701, 560 P3d 85 (2024).\n         We turn to the pertinent underlying historical\nand procedural facts. The state filed a delinquency petition\nagainst youth, then 16 years of age, alleging that when he\nwas between the ages of 13 and 15, he had engaged in con-\nduct with two younger cousins and a half-sister that, if done\nby an adult, would constitute eight felony sex crimes. The\njuvenile court accepted \u201cAlford pleas\u201d from youth on Counts\n1 and 6, and an admission on Count 7.3 It then determined\n     3\n       Counts 1, 6, and 7 of the amended delinquency petition charged youth as\nfollows:\n     \u201cCount 1 Rape in the First Degree (ORS 163.375) (Class A Felony) The said\n     youth, on, about, or between June 30th, 2015 to June 30th, 2017, in Yamhill\n     County, Oregon, did unlawfully and knowingly engage in sexual intercourse\n     with B.H.P., a child under twelve years of age, said act of youth being con-\n     trary to the statutes in such cases made and provided and against the peace\n     and dignity of the State of Oregon.\n     \u201c* * * * *\n     \u201cCount 6 Attempted Sexual Abuse in the First Degree (ORS 161.405) (ORS\n     163.427) (Class C Felony) The said youth, on, about, or between June 30th,\n\f138                                                          State v. B. J. P.\n\nthat youth was within the delinquency jurisdiction of the\njuvenile court.4\n         An Alford plea is a reference to North Carolina v.\nAlford, 400 US 25, 91 S Ct 160, 27 L Ed 2d 162 (1970). It\nis equivalent to a \u201cno contest\u201d plea under ORS 135.335(1)\n(c). Commentary to Criminal Law Revision Commission\nProposed Oregon Criminal Procedure Code, Final Draft\nand Report \u00a7 252, 149 (Nov 1972). As we recently explained:\n    \u201c \u2018An Alford plea is a guilty plea in which the defendant does\n    not admit commission of the criminal act or asserts that he\n    is innocent.\u2019 State v. Sullivan, 197 Or App 26, 28 n 1, 104\n    P3d 636 (2005), rev den, 340 Or 673 (2006) (concluding that\n    it was not plain error for a trial court to rely on an Alford\n    plea as an admission of facts justifying a sentence enhance-\n    ment). With an Alford plea, a defendant does not admit\n    guilt \u2018but admits that sufficient evidence exists to convict\n    him of the offense.\u2019 United States v. Ramirez-Gonzalez, 755\n    F3d 1267, 1273 (11th Cir 2014).\n        \u201cBefore entering a judgment of conviction from a plea\n    of guilty or no contest, the trial court must \u2018mak[e] such\n    inquiry as may satisfy the court that there is a factual basis\n    for the plea.\u2019 ORS 135.395. The \u2018\u201dfactual basis for the plea\u201d\n    refers to facts concerning the defendant\u2019s guilt\u2014i.e., facts\n    regarding whether the defendant committed the crime to\n    which the defendant is pleading.\u2019 State v. Heisser, 232 Or\n    App 320, 329, 222 P3d 719 (2009).\u201d\nState v. Jackson, 319 Or App 789, 791, 511 P3d 82 (2022). In\nproceeding with Alford pleas, youth chose not to contest that\n    2015 to June 30th, 2017, in Yamhill County, Oregon, did unlawfully and\n    intentionally attempt by forcible compulsion to subject T.T., a child under\n    fourteen years of age, to sexual contact, to wit: causing T.T. to touch said\n    youth\u2019s penis, a sexual or intimate part of said youth, said act of youth being\n    contrary to the statutes in such cases made and provided and against the\n    peace and dignity of the State of Oregon.\n        \u201cCount 7 Attempted Sexual Abuse in the First Degree (ORS 161.405)\n        (ORS 163.427) (Class C Felony) The said youth, on, about, or between\n        October 31st, 2015 to October 31st, 2017, in Yamhill County, Oregon,\n        did unlawfully and intentionally attempt to subject G.C., a child under\n        fourteen years of age, to sexual contact, to wit: touching G.C.\u2019s breasts,\n        a sexual or intimate part of G.C., said act of youth being contrary to the\n        statutes in such cases made and provided and against the peace and\n        dignity of the State of Oregon.\u201d\n    4\n      Counts 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 were dismissed by the juvenile court at the time of\njurisdiction.\n\fCite as 339 Or App 134 (2025)                            139\n\nhe engaged in intercourse with his 6-year-old half-sister and\nthat he attempted to forcibly compel his 12-year-old cousin\nto touch his penis. We necessarily presume that the juvenile\ncourt determined that there was a factual basis for those\ncharges when it took youth\u2019s Alford pleas.\n         The juvenile court placed youth on probation for\nfive years with conditions that required him to, among other\nthings, obey all laws, abstain from using or possessing con-\ntrolled substances and alcohol, enter and complete sex-\noffender treatment, and not have contact with minor children.\n         Youth began treatment specifically designed for\njuvenile sexual offenders and he was \u201cpretty solid\u201d in that\nprogram for the first eighteen months. By all accounts,\nyouth was \u201cengaged\u201d in all aspects of his probation, includ-\ning treatment, during that initial time period. But youth\u2019s\nengagement with treatment fell off after he left his grand-\nmother\u2019s home at age 18. He often missed scheduled ther-\napy appointments and meetings with his probation officer.\nYouth submitted to various polygraph examinations, but\nthe results were generally inconclusive, and at one point, he\ntested positive for marijuana and methamphetamine. Youth\ndid not complete sex offender treatment. Consequently, the\ncourt found youth to be in violation of probation. It revoked\nhis probation, sanctioned him with \u201ctime served,\u201d and effec-\ntively ended his period of supervision.\n        Youth sought relief from reporting as a sex offender\npursuant to ORS 163A.030. The hearing began before\none judge in June 2022, but it was discontinued and reset\nto begin before a second judge who conducted the hear-\ning over the course of several days beginning in October\n2022 and concluding in January 2023. Witnesses included\nyouth, Dr. Crossen (licensed psychologist who completed an\nupdated psychosexual evaluation concerning youth), Sean\nClark (youth\u2019s therapist), and Rebecca Newmann (youth\u2019s\nprobation officer).\n        Youth testified that he did not complete treatment,\nand he acknowledged that his failure to complete treatment\nresulted in the revocation of his probation. He testified that\nhe had been given a chance to \u201cre-enroll in [treatment]\n\f140                                             State v. B. J. P.\n\nservices\u201d but that he opted not to do so. Youth identified a\nset of photographs that he took of treatment workbook pages\nthat he kept in a binder. He testified that the handwriting\non those pages included that of his therapist, Clark, his\nprobation officer, Newmann, his dad, and his own \u201cchicken\nscratch.\u201d Clark or Newmann would initial the pages as\nyouth completed the work. He testified that the treatment\nchecklist at the back of the binder contained initials on all\nbut the three items that he did not complete: \u201ccomplete all of\nthe assignments,\u201d \u201ccomplete victim awareness assignment,\u201d\nand \u201ccomplete clarification/apology letter.\u201d Youth testified\nthat he did not write any letters to the victims. In partic-\nular, he testified that because he gave Alford pleas on two\nof the counts, a letter of apology or clarification would not\n\u201chave fit [his] specific needs.\u201d He also did not send a letter to\nthe victim in the count that he admitted.\n        Dr. Crossen testified that she completed youth\u2019s\n\u201cupdated psychosexual evaluation.\u201d Her report was received\nin evidence. The 30-page report details Crossen\u2019s findings\nand conclusions, and she testified about those findings at\nthe hearing. In particular, Crossen concluded,\n   \u201cOverall, [youth\u2019s] current estimate of sex offense recidi-\n   vism is low, and therefore the public would not be offered\n   any additional protection by requiring [youth] to register\n   as a sex offender.\u201d\nCrossen offered her opinion that although youth did not com-\nplete his treatment program, he \u201chas a low need for interven-\ntions at this time.\u201d Indeed, Crossen testified that the sexual\nrecidivism rate for juveniles is very low and that \u201cthe risk\nof re-offending is within the first three years after getting\ncaught.\u201d Crossen testified that various studies address juve-\nnile sexual recidivism rates, and that the Caldwell article\nin particular places that rate at 2.75 percent. Youth rested\nafter Crossen\u2019s testimony, and the hearing was continued to\na date approximately one month later.\n         When the hearing continued the next month, youth\noffered the Caldwell article into evidence. The state objected\nbecause youth had rested the month before and had not\ngiven it a copy of the article until the morning it was offered,\n\fCite as 339 Or App 134 (2025)                                    141\n\njust as the state was about to present its evidence. The court\nruled as follows:\n       \u201cIt gets more awkward when we go into these non\u2014\n   these hearings without evidentiary rules, though, when the\n   evidence code doesn\u2019t apply, it\u2019s harder\u2014it\u2019s harder because\n   most of this stuff needs to come in. But I really don\u2019t want\n   to come back in 2025 and still be litigating this case, so the\n   study itself is not going to come in except for purposes of an\n   offer of proof, if we can keep the testimony about what this\n   study says to ten to fifteen minutes, I will allow it. However,\n   beyond\u2014and I\u2019m allowing it in part because I don\u2019t know\n   that it\u2019s going to make a huge difference to the outcome of\n   this case. Beyond that, though, [youth\u2019s counsel], if this is\n   going to be, you know, an hour worth of testimony on this\n   new issue, I don\u2019t think I can go there because I really don\u2019t\n   want to be still here in three years.\u201d\n         The state then called its witnesses, Clark and\nNewmann. Newmann testified that, other than the conduct\nto which youth admitted at the time of jurisdiction, she was\n\u201caware of no hands-on sexual offenses by [youth].\u201d She fur-\nther testified that youth struggled with the \u201caccountability\u201d\npart of the treatment program, at least in part, because\nhe had not admitted to the underlying conduct. Clark and\nNewmann both confirmed that youth had not completed\ntreatment and that, because of that, his probation had been\nrevoked.\n        The parties agree that the purpose of the hearing\nin question was to determine whether youth, who had been\nadjudicated for felony sex crimes as a juvenile offender,\nwould be required to report as a sex offender under ORS\n163A.030. ORS 163A.030(1) provides, as pertinent:\n   \u201c[T]he juvenile court shall hold a hearing on the issue of\n   reporting as a sex offender by a person who has been found\n   to be within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court under ORS\n   419C.005 * * * for having committed an act that if commit-\n   ted by an adult would constitute a felony sex crime[.]\u201d\nThe statute describes the various procedural and eviden-\ntiary requirements for such hearings and, in particular,\nORS 163A.030(7)(b) describes the burden of proof as follows:\n\f142                                                State v. B. J. P.\n\n      \u201cThe person who is the subject of the hearing has the\n   burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that\n   the person is rehabilitated and does not pose a threat to the\n   safety of the public. If the court finds that the person has\n   not met the burden of proof, the court shall enter an order\n   requiring the person to report as a sex offender under ORS\n   163A.025.\u201d\nAs the Supreme Court explained,\n   \u201cwhether a youth must report as a sex offender under ORS\n   163A.030 depends on a factual inquiry. The youth bears\n   the burden to prove that it is highly probable that they\n   have undergone a process of rehabilitation and do not pres-\n   ent a risk of committing future sex offenses. * * * [T]he juve-\n   nile court may order the youth to report as a sex offender\n   only when it finds that those asserted facts are not highly\n   probable.\u201d\nA. R. H., 371 Or at 95. \u201c[A] youth\u2019s pre-adjudication conduct\nalone will not necessarily permit a finding that the youth\nhas failed to prove * * * that the youth is rehabilitated and\nnot a threat to the safety of the public.\u201d Id. at 88.\n       ORS 163A.030(9) establishes relevance as the\nstandard for admitting evidence in hearings to determine\nwhether a youth must report as a sex offender:\n   \u201c* * * [T]he juvenile court may receive testimony, reports\n   and other evidence, without regard to whether the evidence\n   is admissible under [OEC 100] to [OEC 412] and [OEC 601]\n   to [OEC 1008], if the evidence is relevant evidence related\n   to the determination and findings required under this sec-\n   tion. As used in this subsection, \u2018relevant evidence\u2019 has the\n   meaning given that term in [OEC 401].\u201d\nThat relatively low evidentiary bar is consistent with the\nprocedural flexibility built into delinquency hearings, and\nthe well-settled principles that juvenile proceedings are not\ncriminal trials, State v. R. J. S., 318 Or App 351, 354, 506\nP3d 1151, rev den, 370 Or 211 (2022), and delinquency adju-\ndications are not criminal convictions, ORS 419C.400(5).\nImportantly, though, ORS 163A.030(9) describes what the\njuvenile court \u201cmay\u201d receive; it does not describe what must\nbe received.\n\fCite as 339 Or App 134 (2025)                             143\n\n         As an initial matter, to the extent that youth argues\non appeal that he had no discovery obligation to disclose the\nexhibits at issue before the start of the hearing, that argu-\nment is not preserved, and it is not plain or obvious that it\nis correct. We assume, for current purposes, that a hear-\ning under ORS 163A.030 to determine whether an adjudi-\ncated youth must report as a sex offender is a stage in a\nproceeding within the juvenile court\u2019s exclusive delinquency\njurisdiction under ORS 419C.005. That means that ORS\n419C.270 applies to the proceeding except to the extent the\nspecific provisions of ORS 163A.030 indicate otherwise. And\nwhile ORS 163A.030(9) makes many of the provisions of the\nOregon Evidence Code inapplicable to those hearings, cer-\ntain criminal procedures nevertheless apply in delinquency\nproceedings, and ORS 163A.030 does not speak to the issue\nof discovery but ORS 419C.270 does. Among other things,\nORS 419C.270(6) applies ORS 135.835, ORS 135.845, and\nORS 135.865 to delinquency proceedings.\n         ORS 135.835(3) requires the defendant to \u201cdisclose\nto\u201d the prosecuting attorney \u201c[a]ny books, papers, docu-\nments, photographs or tangible objects that the defense\nintends to offer in evidence at the trial\u201d that are \u201cwithin the\npossession or control of the defense.\u201d ORS 135.845 makes\nthose obligations of disclosure time sensitive, requiring that\ndisclosure occur \u201cas soon as practicable following the filing\u201d\nof the charging instrument, and subjecting the parties to\nongoing duties of disclosure for additional materials that\n\u201ca party finds, either before or during trial[.]\u201d ORS 135.865\nprovides the trial court with sanctions that it may impose\nfor discovery violations including ordering \u201cthe violating\nparty to permit inspection of the material, or grant[ing] a\ncontinuance, or refus[ing] to permit the witness to testify,\nor refus[ing] to receive in evidence the material not dis-\nclosed, or enter[ing] such other order as it considers appro-\npriate.\u201d Thus, because youth did not preserve the issue and\nbecause, as we have explained, it is not obvious that youth\nis correct that no statutory discovery obligations apply in a\nhearing under ORS 163A.030, we assume, without decid-\ning, that ORS 419C.270(6), which governs discovery obliga-\ntions in delinquency cases, applies to hearings under ORS\n163A.030, which does not address discovery obligations,\n\f144                                                          State v. B. J. P.\n\nbecause doing so allows us to give effect to both statutes.5\nSee Powers v. Quigley, 345 Or 432, 438, 198 P3d 919 (2008)\n(\u201c[I]f the court can give full effect to both statutes, it will do\nso, and if not, it will treat the specific statute as an exception\nto the general.\u201d).\n         Youth argues that the Caldwell article, Exhibit\n110, was relevant to the key issues of his rehabilitation\nand whether he poses a threat to the safety of the public.\n\u201cThe crux\u201d of the Caldwell article, according to youth, was\nthat it identified the rate of sexual recidivism in individu-\nals like youth. The article is clearly relevant, but the state\ndoes not dispute that, and the juvenile court did not exclude\nthe Caldwell article on relevance grounds. It ultimately\nexcluded the article after this discussion with counsel:\n        \u201c[PROSECUTOR]: So, Your Honor, this was just pro-\n    vided to me this morning, the testimony was last month, I\n    haven\u2019t had a chance to read it, Dr. Crossen testified about\n    it, given that it\u2019s essentially late discovery, there was tes-\n    timony from the Defense expert in relation to that, I would\n    object to just the study being entered into the record due to\n    the discovery I guess late violation as well as Dr. Crossen\u2019s\n    already testified to what she wanted in relation to that and\n    the State would not have time to prepare or to look at any\n    contradicting studies or be able to have a conversation with\n    anybody related to that study.\n        \u201cTHE COURT: [Counsel for youth]?\n       \u201c[YOUTH\u2019S COUNSEL]:           * * * [C]ounsel[ ] had the\n    opportunity to cross-examine Dr. Crossen, also this study\n    she referred to * * * has to do with the very decision that\n    Your Honor is making, which is the recidivism rate gen-\n    erally and then the fact that my client fits within that\n    category of adolescents, so I would think that under the\n\n    5\n      We acknowledge that ORS 135.835 and ORS 135.845 refer to \u201cthe fil-\ning of an indictment or information,\u201d \u201cthe defense,\u201d and \u201cthe trial.\u201d But ORS\n419C.270(6) makes those provisions applicable to delinquency proceedings under\nORS 419C.005, and given that, we assume that those terms must be read to make\nsense in that context as references, respectively, to delinquency petitions, youth,\nand fact-finding hearings. We likewise read those provisions to make sense in\nthe context of delinquency hearings under ORS 163A.030 as references to peti-\ntions for relief from reporting requirements, youth, and the fact-finding hearing\nrequired by ORS 163A.030. As noted, youth did not preserve any argument that\nthere is no statutory discovery process that applies to ORS 163A.030 hearings.\nThat issue is not before us and we do not decide it.\n\fCite as 339 Or App 134 (2025)                                 145\n\n  very loose rule of evidence in a disposition-type hearing in\n  juvenile that anything that would be useful to the Court to\n  have these * * * would certainly fall within that category of\n  relevance.\n     \u201cTHE COURT: I\u2019m going to go ahead and receive the\n  exhibit, but if you want to cross-examine Dr. Crossen addi-\n  tionally, [prosecutor], if you want some additional time\u2014\n      \u201c[PROSECUTOR]: And so Your Honor is essentially\n  saying, hey, you know, we\u2019re\u2014this is day five of this hear-\n  ing, Dr. Crossen at the first hearing testified to that study,\n  it wasn\u2019t provided to the State, so now we\u2019re here on month\n  11, I think, and we\u2019re getting brand new discovery from the\n  Defense, so I can\u2019t possibly make a decision of potentially\n  need[ing] more time when we have victims who have been\n  waiting for this determination as well as I\u2019m sure [youth]\n  as well and we\u2019re getting new stuff from the Defense, which\n  is the State like\u2014\n     \u201cTHE COURT: Why wasn\u2019t it given to [the prosecutor]\n  earlier?\n      \u201c[YOUTH\u2019S COUNSEL]: I just, I asked Dr. Crossen for\n  it because she talked about it repeatedly because I wanted\n  to read it, so I looked at it and I thought it would be use-\n  ful, I just didn\u2019t prepare it for today, so it\u2019s not something\n  that, you know, I thought about other than, as I said, I\u2019m\n  just saying I think it\u2019s highly relevant to the decision Your\n  Honor\u2019s making, it\u2019s just, you know, it is being provided to\n  the Court today, so\u2014\n     \u201c[PROSECUTOR]: And so, Your Honor, that study is\n  referenced in Dr. Crossen\u2019s report from I believe April, so\n  that\u2019s when [youth\u2019s counsel] would have learned of it and\n  would have had the opportunity to do that, we were here in\n  June, we talked about it then, I just, I think it\u2019s manifestly\n  unfair to the State to come in on this\u2014on a bifurcated\n  hearing to have, hey, here\u2019s new information that you pre-\n  viously didn\u2019t have that I\u2019m going to submit as an exhibit\n  without giving you the opportunity to review or be able to\n  address it in any capacity. There I have to feel like there\n  has to be some limit on\u2014\n     \u201cTHE COURT: Yeah, and you\u2019re right\u2014\n     \u201c[PROSECUTOR]: \u2014on when the Defense and just\n  history on this case, Your Honor, when we were in front of\n\f146                                              State v. B. J. P.\n\n   [a different judge], on day two of that hearing the Defense\n   provided the State with what has been admitted as treat-\n   ment notes, so this is something that\u2019s been habitual in\n   this case, I\u2019m afraid if we set this over again the Defense\n   will provide additional exhibits and additional materials\n   every single time we come back\u2014\n      \u201cTHE COURT: The last thing I want to do is set this\n   over again, I will not, I will change my mind on that, I will\n   not receive the exhibit[.]\u201d\nThe parties characterize the trial court\u2019s decision to exclude\nthe Caldwell article as a discovery sanction, but they dis-\nagree about whether it was a proper exercise of the court\u2019s\ndiscretion.\n         We agree that the juvenile court excluded the\nCaldwell article as a discovery violation sanction. As we\nalready explained, youth had an obligation to disclose any\ntangible exhibits that he planned to offer at the hearing,\nand that obligation was ongoing as to \u201cadditional material\nor information\u201d that he became aware of as the hearing pro-\nceeded. The obligation is time-sensitive, requiring prompt\nnotice of any new material. The disclosure obligation is trig-\ngered when a party can \u201creasonably predict\u201d that he will\nintroduce the evidence. See State v. Young, 94 Or App 683,\n689, 767 P2d 90 (1989).\n          Youth is correct that, under OEC 705, an expert may\ntestify to their opinion \u201cand give reasons therefor without\nprior disclosure of the underlying facts or data.\u201d However,\nand as happened here, \u201c[t]he expert may in any event be\nrequired to disclose the underlying facts or data on cross-\nexamination.\u201d OEC 705. Once youth became aware of the\nCaldwell article through Crossen\u2019s testimony and decided to\noffer it as an exhibit, he had a duty to promptly notify the\nstate of his intent to do so. Given that youth had finished\npresenting his case-in-chief and had rested without offering\nthe Caldwell article into evidence, it was not error for the\njuvenile court to conclude that he violated his ongoing dis-\ncovery obligation by not notifying the state that he intended\nto offer the article as an exhibit. Indeed, youth waited for\nthe state to begin presenting its evidence, a month later,\nand then offered the exhibit with no notice at all.\n\fCite as 339 Or App 134 (2025)                              147\n\n         The sanctions available to the juvenile court under\nORS 135.865 ranged from granting a continuance to exclud-\ning the Caldwell article. It is apparent that the court consid-\nered a continuance but determined that exclusion was more\nappropriate under the circumstances. We cannot say that\nthe court abused its discretion, especially given the length\nof time that had passed since youth filed his petition, and\nCrossen\u2019s extensive testimony about the Caldwell article.\n         Youth offered the Kettrey article, Exhibit 112, which\naddresses whether individuals like youth must complete\ntreatment to \u201cfall into the low recidivism category,\u201d during\nhis rebuttal case when he recalled Crossen. Again, the state\ndoes not dispute the relevance of the Kettrey article. After\nhearing from the parties, the juvenile court stated that if it\nwere to \u201ccontinue to receive new exhibits every single [day]\n* * * we will never get this hearing * * * done.\u201d The court\nlater clarified that it would allow Crossen to testify about\nwhether completing a treatment program impacts recidi-\nvism, but that the Kettrey article itself would be excluded.\nWe conclude that the juvenile court did not abuse its discre-\ntion in excluding the Kettrey article for the same reasons it\ndid not abuse its discretion in excluding the Caldwell article.\n         Youth offered a binder of the original workbook\npages from his sex offender treatment program as Exhibit\n111 when he presented his rebuttal case. But youth had,\nin his case-in-chief, already successfully offered Exhibit\n109, which consisted of photographs that he testified he\nhad taken of the pages in his treatment workbook that\nhe had kept in a binder. When questioned about Exhibit\n109 on cross-examination, youth testified that he thought\nExhibit 109 was a complete copy of his notebook but, when\npressed about that, he indicated that he was not certain. His\ntherapist, Clark, later testified that a treatment checklist\nincluded in youth\u2019s Exhibit 109 looked \u201codd\u201d to him because,\namong other reasons, it was \u201cpretty much completely signed\noff\u201d even though he would not typically sign off on such a list\nuntil the end of treatment, which youth did not complete.\n         Youth offered Exhibit 111 to rebut the suggestion\nthat he had \u201cforged\u201d the treatment checklist. In particu-\nlar, he offered Exhibit 111 as \u201crelevant for Your Honor to\n\f148                                              State v. B. J. P.\n\nsee some other original initialings also in the notebook\ndone by Mr. Clark.\u201d The primary focus of the state\u2019s cross-\nexamination of youth about Exhibit 109 was on the check-\nlist. The juvenile court separated the original checklist from\nthe proffered exhibit and received it as Exhibit 113, ruling:\n   \u201cI am going to receive the original of the treatment check-\n   list, I\u2019m not going to receive the originals of anything else\n   * * * that\u2019s duplicative.\u201d\nThe juvenile court, as trier of fact, heard the testimony of\nyouth and Clark concerning the treatment binder, and it\nhad received Exhibits 109 and 113, showing photographs\nof the workbook and the original treatment checklist.\nTherefore, the juvenile court received the original checklist\nthat was at issue during youth\u2019s cross-examination, permit-\nting it to assess the document\u2019s authenticity, and it other-\nwise excluded the portions of the notebook that were dupli-\ncative of the photographs provided in Exhibit 109. Even if,\nfor the purpose of argument only, it was error for the court\nto exclude the rest of Exhibit 111, the evidence excluded was\n\u201cmerely cumulative of admitted evidence\u201d and therefore, its\nexclusion was harmless. State v. Jasperse, 310 Or App 703,\n711, 487 P3d 402, rev den, 368 Or 787 (2021) (internal quo-\ntation marks omitted).\n        Turning, finally, to the juvenile court\u2019s conclusion\nthat youth failed to meet his burden under ORS 163A.030\nand that he must, therefore, report as a sex offender, the\ncourt explained its ruling from the bench as follows:\n       \u201cOn this record, the alleged acts, two of the counts of\n   which he took Alford pleas, one of the counts which he\n   admitted, they\u2019re fairly serious alleged offenses, we have\n   multiple victims, two of whom have significant age gap, at\n   least at the time, between themselves and [youth]. And on\n   this record I feel like I have more questions than answers.\n   I have questions about the youth\u2019s credibility, I have ques-\n   tions about what really happened to the victims, I have\n   questions about why the youth didn\u2019t complete treatment, I\n   have questions about why the youth didn\u2019t at least complete\n   the empathy assignments, the clarification assignments as\n   to the victim that he admitted, I have questions about why\n   the youth seems to minimize what happened even to the\n   victim that he acknowledges, I have questions about why\n\fCite as 339 Or App 134 (2025)                               149\n\n   the youth wasn\u2019t able to better articulate things that he\n   learned in treatment.\n      \u201cI think given those questions and I think given the\n   static factors, I think as [youth\u2019s counsel] has typically\n   described them in other cases, it does pain me, but I find\n   that the youth has not proven by clear and convincing evi-\n   dence that he is rehabilitated and does not pose a safety\n   threat to the public[.]\u201d\nIn its written order, the juvenile court found that \u201cyouth\nhas not proven, by clear and convincing evidence, that he or\nshe is rehabilitated and does not pose a safety threat to the\npublic.\u201d\n         We acknowledge that, when making its oral ruling,\nthe court stated its findings in terms of \u201cquestions\u201d that it\nhad about the nature of the underlying juvenile offenses,\nyouth\u2019s present day credibility, why youth continued to min-\nimize the effect of his offenses on the victims, why he did not\ncomplete treatment\u2014in particular his failure to complete\nthe empathy and clarification assignments\u2014and why youth\ncould not articulate what he had learned in treatment. By\nnoting the many questions it had at the conclusion of the\nhearing, we understand the juvenile court to have been\nexplaining the weaknesses it found in youth\u2019s case and con-\nnecting those weaknesses to youth\u2019s current risk of sexual\nrecidivism. In its explanation, the court relied on risk factors\nthat included youth\u2019s recent failure to complete treatment,\nwhich included, in part, his ongoing refusal to work with the\nvictims vis-\u00e0-vis clarification and empathy assignments. The\nfact that youth entered Alford pleas to two of the charged\noffenses does not explain or excuse his present-day refusal\nto complete treatment, and it did not require the juvenile\ncourt to ignore his treatment deficiencies. First, youth failed\nto complete the clarification and empathy assignments even\nwith respect to the victim of the offense to which he offered\nhis outright admission. And second, youth\u2019s decision not to\ncontest two of the charges and to necessarily accept being\nadjudicated on those charges does not explain his refusal to\ncomplete treatment, his resulting violation of probation, or\nhis decision to opt out of treatment even when it was again\noffered to him. Also, the juvenile court was free to accept or\nreject the expert testimony it heard about sexual recidivism\n\f150                                          State v. B. J. P.\n\nrates and treatment. See Kotler and Winnett, 282 Or App\n584, 598, 385 P3d 1200 (2016) (explaining that a witness\u2019s\n\u201ctestimony was not entitled to greater weight simply because\n[the witness] is an expert; as with all conflicting evidence,\nthe probative value of such evidence is solely for the trial\ncourt to determine\u201d). Given all that, we cannot say that the\nrecord compelled the court to conclude other than it did.\n        Affirmed.\n\f",

J.\n         Youth appeals a juvenile court order denying his\npetition to dismiss jurisdiction. In his petition, youth sought\npost-adjudication relief, under both the state and federal con-\nstitutions, on a claim under ORS 419C.615(1)(a)1 that his trial\ncounsel was constitutionally inadequate and ineffective in fail-\ning to move to suppress statements that youth made to police,\nand that, had those statements been suppressed, he would\nnot have admitted to conduct that, if committed by an adult,\nwould constitute one count of second-degree sexual abuse, ORS\n163.425, and one count of strangulation, ORS 163.187.\n         On appeal, youth raises one assignment of error,\nin which he contends that the juvenile court erred in deny-\ning his petition to dismiss jurisdiction, as trial counsel was\ninadequate and ineffective in failing to file a motion to sup-\npress youth\u2019s statements to police. Accepting the juvenile\ncourt\u2019s supported implicit and explicit factual findings and\nreviewing for legal error, State v. C. L. E., 316 Or App 5, 6,\n502 P3d 1154 (2021), we affirm.\n         In evaluating whether youth was entitled to post-\nadjudication relief under ORS 419C.615(1)(a), \u201cwe apply\nthe constitutional standards for inadequate and ineffec-\ntive assistance of counsel that have been developed at the\nstate and federal level in the context of post-conviction and\nhabeas corpus relief.\u201d State v. J. J.-M., 282 Or App 459, 463,\n387 P3d 426 (2016). To prevail on a claim of inadequate and\nineffective assistance of counsel under those constitutional\nstandards, youth must have proved both a performance and\na prejudice prong. Id. at 464; see also Johnson v. Premo, 315\nOr App 1, 8, 499 P3d 814 (2021) (stating the \u201cfunctionally\nequivalent\u201d standards for inadequate and ineffective assis-\ntance of counsel under the state and federal constitutions).\n     1\n       ORS 419C.615 provides, as relevant:\n          \u201c(1) In addition to any other grounds upon which a person may petition\n     a court under ORS 419C.610, a person may petition the court on the following\n     grounds to set aside an order finding the person to be within the jurisdiction\n     of the court under ORS 419C.005:\n          \u201c(a) A substantial denial in the proceedings resulting in the person\u2019s\n     adjudication, or in the appellate review of the adjudication, of the person\u2019s\n     rights under the United States Constitution or the Oregon Constitution, or\n     both, and the denial rendered the adjudication void[.]\u201d\n\fCite as 339 Or App 35 (2025)                                 37\n\n         Youth argues that the juvenile court erred when it\ndenied youth relief on his claim of inadequate and ineffec-\ntive assistance of counsel. As youth sees it, his trial coun-\nsel\u2019s performance was deficient because youth \u201chad a meri-\ntorious argument that his statements [to police] should have\nbeen suppressed\u201d but trial counsel \u201cdid not see a suppression\nissue.\u201d The state responds that \u201cyouth failed to prove that\nhis attorney performed deficiently by pursuing an early,\nfavorable resolution rather than filing a motion to suppress\u201d\nor that \u201cthe alleged deficient performance resulted in preju-\ndice.\u201d We address each prong\u2014the performance prong and\nthe prejudice prong\u2014in turn.\n          Regarding the performance prong, it was youth\u2019s\nburden to prove that \u201c \u2018counsel\u2019s decision reflects an absence\nof professional skill and judgment, a question that turns on\nthe facts known at the time that counsel made that deci-\nsion.\u2019 \u201d C. L. E., 316 Or App at 10 (quoting Davis v. Kelly, 303\nOr App 253, 262, 461 P3d 1043, rev den, 366 Or 826 (2020)).\n         Applying that standard here, the record reflects\nthat trial counsel\u2019s decision not to pursue suppression of\nyouth\u2019s statements to police did not reflect an absence of\nprofessional skill and judgment. Youth\u2019s trial counsel testi-\nfied at the hearing on the petition to set aside jurisdiction\nthat she had viewed the evidence of the police interrogation\nof youth and opined that it \u201clooked like a revocation of any\ninvoking of his right to remain silent.\u201d That is, suppression\nof youth\u2019s statements was unlikely to be successful, because,\nalthough youth invoked his right to remain silent, he sub-\nsequently spoke to police after receiving Miranda warnings,\nand he was also evaluated by a doctor who concluded that\nthere were no concerns regarding youth\u2019s ability to under-\nstand his Miranda rights. See State v. McAnulty, 356 Or 432,\n458, 338 P3d 653 (2014) (explaining that when a suspect has\ninvoked their right to remain silent, \u201cpolice may reinitiate\ncontact after a reasonable time, provide new Miranda warn-\nings, and obtain a valid waiver\u201d). We do not understand this\nto be a case where youth\u2019s trial counsel simply failed to \u201csee\u201d\na meritorious legal issue, as youth contends.\n         Further, trial counsel\u2019s testimony reflects that other\nfactors in youth\u2019s case bore on trial counsel\u2019s decision not to\n\f38                                           State v. D. W. N.\n\npursue suppression, including that the state would revoke\nits plea offer on the filing of that motion and might charge\nyouth as an adult; that a successful motion would likely lead\nto a trial on the more serious charge of first-degree rape;\nthat the victim was \u201cadamant\u201d about the case going to trial;\nthat the state would still have the victim\u2019s statements as\nevidence even if youth\u2019s statements were suppressed; and\nthat youth would not be able to testify even if his statements\nwere suppressed to avoid \u201copening the door\u201d to admission of\nthose suppressed statements. In addition, an affidavit sub-\nmitted by the prosecutor in youth\u2019s case averred that, had\nthe trial court \u201centertained a suppression of [youth\u2019s state-\nments to police], the [plea] offer would have been immedi-\nately revoked and the state would have proceeded to trial on\nall the allegations in the original petition.\u201d The prosecutor\nfurther averred that, had a motion to suppress been granted,\n\u201cthe state would have absolutely proceeded to trial without\nyouth\u2019s statements[,]\u201d because the remaining evidence, in\nthe prosecutor\u2019s view, \u201cwould have been sufficiently compel-\nling to prove the allegations beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d\n         Thus, we conclude that trial counsel\u2019s decision not to\npursue suppression of youth\u2019s statements was not deficient\nbecause it was a strategic decision and a reasonable exercise\nof professional skill and judgment in response to the circum-\nstances. See, e.g., Gorham v. Thompson, 332 Or 560, 567, 34\nP3d 161 (2001) (explaining that \u201ca reviewing court will not\nsecond-guess a lawyer\u2019s tactical decisions in the name of the\nconstitution unless those decisions reflect an absence or sus-\npension of professional skill and judgment\u201d).\n         But even if that trial counsel\u2019s performance was\ndeficient, we conclude that there was no prejudice. Under\nthe prejudice prong, we \u201cfocus[ ] on whether trial counsel\u2019s\nconstitutionally inadequate performance affected the out-\ncome of the plea process\u201d in cases such as this one \u201cwhere\nthe adjudication is based on a plea.\u201d C. L. E., 316 Or App at\n16. To establish prejudice, youth was required to \u201cshow that\nbut for the inadequate and ineffective assistance, he would\nhave pleaded differently.\u201d Id.\n         The evidence that youth offered to prove prejudice\nis his written declaration in which he attests that, had trial\n\fCite as 339 Or App 35 (2025)                                                     39\n\ncounsel moved to suppress his statements, he \u201cwould not\nhave accepted the plea agreement\u201d and \u201cwould not have\nentered admissions[.]\u201d However, the juvenile court was per-\nmitted to make a determination that youth was not credible.\nConsequently, we conclude that youth did not prove that he\nwas prejudiced by trial counsel\u2019s failure to move to suppress\nhis statements.2\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n       The juvenile court did not explain its reason for denying youth\u2019s petition;\nthat is, it did not indicate whether the denial was based on a determination that\nyouth had failed to meet the performance prong of his claim, the prejudice prong\nof his claim, or both.\n     Youth contends that \u201cbecause the trial court could have denied relief without\nreaching the issue of prejudice, this court should reverse and remand for the\ncourt to consider youth\u2019s evidence [regarding prejudice] in the first instance.\u201d\n     For this court to perform its review function, it is helpful when a lower court\nexplains the basis for its ruling. As the Supreme Court stated in Datt v. Hill,\n347 Or 672, 684, 227 P3d 714 (2010), \u201c[i]t is a truism, and an important one,\nthat a post-conviction trial court can be of great assistance to appellate courts\nby making findings of historical facts and explaining how its conclusions derive\nfrom those findings.\u201d That is, \u201c[a]n understanding of how a post-conviction trial\ncourt actually, rather than presumptively, arrived at its decision enhances the\neffectiveness of appellate review.\u201d Id. at 685; see also Pereida-Alba v. Coursey, 356\nOr 654, 670-71, 342 P3d 70 (2015) (noting that \u201cwe presume that a trial court\nimplicitly resolves factual disputes consistently with its ultimate conclusion\u201d but\nthat \u201c[i]f an implicit factual finding is not necessary to a trial court\u2019s ultimate\nconclusion * * *, then the presumption does not apply\u201d). We think the important\n\u201ctruism\u201d that the Supreme Court observed in Datt applies equally to a claim\nfor post-adjudication relief under ORS 419C.615(1)(a)\u2014the kind of claim at issue\nin this appeal\u2014as it does to a claim seeking relief under the Post-Conviction\nHearings Act\u2014the kind of claim at issue in Datt.\n     In any event, for purposes of our analysis, we have assumed that the juvenile\ncourt denied youth\u2019s motion on either the performance prong, the prejudice prong,\nor both; and, as set forth above, the record was sufficient for the juvenile court\nto have denied youth\u2019s motion on either (or both) of those bases. Remand for the\njuvenile court to address the prejudice prong in the first instance is unnecessary.\nCf. Dickerson v. Fhuere, 316 Or App 62, 67, 501 P3d 1072 (2021) (reversing and\nremanding \u201cbecause the post-conviction court\u2019s decision was based on an error\nof law and, as a result of that error, the court never made the factual determina-\ntions necessary to allow for resolution of petitioner\u2019s claim under the correct legal\nstandard\u201d).\n\f",

In addition, an affidavit sub-\nmitted by the prosecutor in youth\u2019s case averred that, had\nthe trial court \u201centertained a suppression of [youth\u2019s state-\nments to police], the [plea] offer would have been immedi-\nately revoked and the state would have proceeded to trial on\nall the allegations in the original petition.\u201d The prosecutor\nfurther averred that, had a motion to suppress been granted,\n\u201cthe state would have absolutely proceeded to trial without\nyouth\u2019s statements[,]\u201d because the remaining evidence, in\nthe prosecutor\u2019s view, \u201cwould have been sufficiently compel-\nling to prove the allegations beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d\n         Thus, we conclude that trial counsel\u2019s decision not to\npursue suppression of youth\u2019s statements was not deficient\nbecause it was a strategic decision and a reasonable exercise\nof professional skill and judgment in response to the circum-\nstances.

As we explain below, defendant did not do so\nand we, therefore, reject his first assignment as unpreserved.\n         The trial court, on defendant\u2019s request, severed the\nvarious charges into two trials: one for charges connected to\na pair of coffee shop robberies, and one for charges related to\nburglaries at a credit union and a Fred Meyer store.

BRYANT DONALDSON, JR.\n\n                 Appeal from the Criminal Court for Wilson County\n                     No. 20-CR-119     Brody N.

After a sentencing hearing, the trial court\nimposed an effective twenty-three-year sentence. Defendant appeals, arguing that the trial\ncourt erred in admitting his psychosexual evaluation and a victim impact statement at\nsentencing and that the trial court misapplied enhancement factors. Upon our review of\nthe entire record, the briefs of the parties, and the applicable law, we affirm the judgments\nof the trial court.\n\n Tenn. R. App. P. 3 Appeal as of Right; Judgments of the Criminal Court Affirmed\n\nJILL BARTEE AYERS, J., delivered the opinion of the court, in which ROBERT L.\nHOLLOWAY, JR., and ROBERT H. MONTGOMERY, JR., JJ., joined.\n\nDaniel J. Turklay, Lebanon, Tennessee, for the appellant, Bryant Donaldson, Jr.\n\nJonathan Skrmetti, Attorney General and Reporter; Ryan Dugan, Assistant Attorney\nGeneral; Jason Lawson, District Attorney General; and Thomas Harwell Swink, Assistant\nDistrict Attorney General, for the appellee, State of Tennessee.\n\n                                        OPINION\n\n                          Factual and Procedural Background\n\n       On February 12, 2020, Defendant was indicted for one count of especially\naggravated sexual exploitation of a minor (count one), six counts of statutory rape by an\nauthority figure (counts two through seven), and six counts of aggravated statutory rape\n(counts eight through thirteen). The case proceeded to trial on July 27, 2021. After the\nState completed voir dire, a plea agreement was reached. Pursuant to the plea agreement,\n\fDefendant pled guilty to counts one and eight through thirteen in exchange for the dismissal\nof counts two through seven. The trial court would determine the length and manner of\nsentence. We note that the appellate record does not contain a transcript of trial\nproceedings or of Defendant\u2019s plea submission. See State v. Keen, 996 S.W.2d 842, 843-\n44 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1999) (\u201c[A] transcript of the guilty plea hearing is often (if not\nalways) needed in order to conduct a proper review of the sentence imposed.\u201d); Tenn. R.\nApp. P. 24(b) (stating that the appellant has the duty to prepare a record which conveys a\n\u201cfair, accurate and complete account of what transpired with respect to those issues that are\nthe bases of appeal\u201d). An appellate who fails to include the transcript of the guilty plea\nhearing in the record risks waiver of a sentencing issue. This court determines on a case-\nby-case basis whether the record is sufficient for meaningful review without the inclusion\nof the plea submission transcript. State v. Caudle, 388 S.W.3d 273, 279 (Tenn. 2012). In\nthis case, we will consider the merits of Defendant\u2019s sentencing issues because the facts of\nthe offense are sufficiently stated in the presentence report. The relevant facts underlying\nthe plea, as provided in the presentence report, are as follows:\n\n       On January 11, 2020, . . . officers with the Wilson County Sheriff\u2019s\n       Department were dispatched to [the victim\u2019s house regarding] a possible\n       rape. Detectives arrived at the residence, where the 14[-]year[-]old female\n       victim . . . resided with her mother and others, including the victim\u2019s 15[-\n       ]year[-]old sister and [Defendant]. Upon arrival detectives made contact\n       with the victim\u2019s mother, who[] advised that she had checked [the victim\u2019s]\n       phone and found a picture of a penis and a video of [the victim] in a sexual\n       act with [Defendant]. She advised that she recognized the location that the\n       video was taken as in the laundry room . . . . The phone was placed into\n       evidence and the laundry room photographed. At this time the victim was\n       being taken to [S]ummit [H]ospital by her grandmother. Detectives then\n       received a call from Summit Hospital Emergency Room nurse stating that\n       the victim was being transported to Our Kids (Nashville General Hospital)\n       to have a sexual assault kit conducted. After leaving [the victim\u2019s house],\n       deputies transported [Defendant] to the Sheriff\u2019s Department to be\n       interviewed. Detectives met with [Defendant] at the Sheriff\u2019s [D]epartment\n       and upon being advised of his rights[, Defendant] agreed to speak with\n       detectives. [Defendant] was asked about his relationship with the victim and\n       [Defendant] stated that \u201cshe looks up to him\u201d and that they just sit around\n       and talk. [Defendant] was then asked if he had had any sexual contact with\n       the victim and he denied having any sexual relationship with her. Detectives\n       explained the video evidence they ha[d] in which showed [Defendant] and\n       the victim engaging in a sexual act. [Defendant] denied a sexual act and\n       argued that detectives did not have a video of him. He stated that he has only\n       had a parenting[,] role model type relationship with the victim. Upon being\n                                            -2-\n\fasked if he had taken any type of drugs, [Defendant] stated that he takes drugs\non a daily basis and had used earlier the same day but would not elaborate\non what drugs he had taken. It was determined that the subject was under\nthe influence at that time and the interview was stopped. . . .\n\nOn January 13, 2020[,] the victim\u2019s mother stated to detectives that she had\njust found out that her other daughter (K.R.) had also been approached by\n[D]efendant in a sexual manner. A forensic interview was then conducted\nwith the victim at the child advocacy center on the date of January 13, 2020.\nDuring this interview the victim reported that she understood that she is here\nto talk about Bryant \u201cbubba\u201d Donaldson and what happened. She stated that\n[Defendant] is Sierra\u2019s brother (Sierra lives with them). She reported that\nthe incidents started around August of 2019 in which she and [Defendant]\nbegan talking as friends and about a month after things progressed. She\nstated that he would tell her that he loved her, wanted to marry her and have\nkids with her. She stated that a few days prior to the interview they had sex.\nShe stated that her mother went through her phone and found pictures and\nvideo of her and [Defendant]. She stated that her grandmother then drove\nher to Summit Hospital and then to Our Kids. She stated that the incident on\nSaturday was not the only time they had sex, the first time was around August\nor September 2019. She stated that [Defendant] would touch her body all\nover before they had sex (breasts, legs, vagina). She stated that the first time\nthey had sex was in the basement of her mother\u2019s house on the couch. After\nthey had sex, she stated that [Defendant] would digitally penetrate her\nvagina. She stated that he did not use protection when they had sex. She\nreported that they had sex multiple times. She stated that the first time they\nhad sex it did hurt her for a few seconds but did not hurt later. She stated\nthat on Saturday (January 11, 2020) they had sex with him penetrating her\nvaginally standing behind her with her hands on the wall. She stated that she\nperformed oral sex on [Defendant] twice, all incidents did occur in the\nbasement. She stated that everyone else was usually upstairs in the home\nwhen they had sex. When they had sex he would ejaculate both outside and\ninside of her. She stated that after the first time she told her sister (K.R.).\nLater on January 13, 2020[,] the victim\u2019s sister (K.R.) was interviewed at the\nchild advocacy center, with her mother present. K.R. stated that she has\nknown [Defendant] for approximately [ten] years and they refer to him as\n\u201cbubba.\u201d She reported that [Defendant] had moved in with them in June\n2019 but sometimes stays with his sister Brandy in Gordonsville. She stated\nthat [Defendant] does not have a phone, car or a job and is often at home\nwhen everyone else is gone. Upon being asked about the sleeping\narrangements of the household[,] K.R. states that he often slept in her\n                                     -3-\n\f      mother\u2019s room or downstairs in the basement. She stated that everyone else\n      slept in bedrooms on the main floor of the house. She was then asked about\n      the sexual incidents between her sister and [Defendant] and she stated that\n      she had not seen the incidents but described an incident in which the three of\n      them were downstairs and she could hear the victim and [Defendant]\n      whispering. Upon asking what they were whispering about[,] [Defendant]\n      told her that they were making a bet that on whether she (K.R.) would have\n      sex with him or with them. She states that she told them that she wouldn\u2019t\n      and they stopped discussing it. She states that [Defendant] told her that he\n      and the victim were \u201cinterrupted\u201d earlier that day and they were going to\n      finish. She then states that [Defendant] and the victim then went into the\n      victim\u2019s room to \u201cfinish.\u201d She states that this occurred about a week and a\n      half ago. She then spoke of another incident in which they were at\n      [Defendant]\u2019s sister\u2019s house in Gordonsville and she was babysitting his\n      sister\u2019s kids. She states that while they were there he typed \u201cwill you have\n      sex with me, I will give you money or something you want\u201d into his phone\n      and showed it to her. She stated that she again refused. She stated that these\n      were the only times he asked her to do it but that he frequently made \u201csly\n      comments\u201d about it to her. She stated that she had asked the victim about\n      her sexual relationship with [Defendant] and she states that the victim told\n      her that she (the victim) and [Defendant] had had sex \u201ctoo many times to\n      count.\u201d Interviewer then spoke to K.R. about the difficulties of this type of\n      interview and the importance for her to be open and honest and that she was\n      not in any kind of trouble. K.R. then stated that in that case, there was another\n      incident in which one day [Defendant] had yelled at her to come into the\n      laundry room that he had something to tell her and when she went in he began\n      kissing her and he put his hand down her pants and she told him to stop. On\n      May 25, 2020[,] the [Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (\u201cTBI\u201d)] crime lab\n      issued a report indicating their analysis of the sexual assault kit and report\n      revealed the . . . sperm found on the victim\u2019s labia and vaginal swabs were a\n      DNA match to [Defendant].\n\n       On March 21, 2022, the trial court conducted a sentencing hearing. Defendant\u2019s\npresentence report, which included the victim\u2019s mother\u2019s victim impact statement, was\nadmitted into evidence. As noted in the presentence report, Defendant reported that he\n\u201cwas out of [his] mind\u201d when the victim \u201capproached [him] and [he] allowed it to happen.\u201d\nThe report also showed a confirmed gang affiliation and Defendant\u2019s criminal history\nwhich included convictions for aggravated robbery and failure to appear. Regarding his\naggravated robbery conviction, Defendant was sentenced to eight years suspended to\nprobation; following two violations, his probation was revoked. Defendant reported his\nmental health as \u201cpoor\u201d and admitted to alcohol and drug problems. He first drank alcohol\n                                            -4-\n\fat age thirteen, used heroin from 2018 until his arrest in 2020, and used methamphetamine\nand marijuana from \u201c2007 / 2008 until his arrest in 2020.\u201d Defendant reported that his\ndrug and alcohol use contributed to his current charges. Defendant\u2019s Strong-R Risk and\nNeeds Assessment resulted in risk score of \u201chigh.\u201d\n\n       The State then read the victim\u2019s mother\u2019s victim impact statement into the record.\nIn the statement, the victim\u2019s mother expressed that Defendant had \u201ctaken [her] child\u2019s\ninnocence away\u201d and caused the victim to be \u201cfull of anger and rage and hate.\u201d The\nvictim\u2019s mother questioned whether Defendant had \u201cput together a big master plan to use\n[her] so [he] could get to [her] girls[.]\u201d She expressed her belief that this was not an isolated\nincident and \u201cpray[ed] . . . that no little girl is ever around\u201d Defendant again. The victim\u2019s\nmother requested Defendant receive the maximum sentence.\n\n       Defendant objected to the State\u2019s reading of the victim impact statement,\nacknowledging that the victim has a right to put a statement into the record but requesting\nthat the trial court \u201cnot consider any hearsay that was contained in the statement as\nsubstantive evidence against [Defendant], things that, you know, the child victim might\nhave said, you know, to the mother, specifically.\u201d The court noted the victim impact\nstatement had not been subjected to cross-examination and stated it would \u201cgrant it the\nweight it\u2019s due, based on what [it\u2019s] heard.\u201d\n\n       Defendant\u2019s psychosexual evaluation was also admitted into evidence. Defendant\nnoted that he had \u201cassumed\u201d that the doctor who conducted the evaluation would testify\nbut acknowledged that the report was likely admissible even without the doctor\u2019s\ntestimony. However, \u201cto the extent that [he was] wrong about that and the statute doesn\u2019t\nspecifically allow that in,\u201d Defendant maintained his objection to the admission of the\npsychosexual evaluation without an opportunity to cross-examine the doctor.\n\n       The psychosexual evaluation included information regarding Defendant\u2019s current\nmental status, his family and interpersonal relationships, academic and criminal history,\nand psychiatric and substance abuse history. It also included questionnaires, objective\ntesting, and tools to determine Defendant\u2019s risk to reoffend. According to Defendant\u2019s\nversion of events, the victim \u201cwas the aggressor\u201d and was \u201cthrowing herself\u201d at him until\n\u201ceventually [Defendant] gave in.\u201d Defendant stated that the victim performed oral sex on\nhim, but he denied sexual intercourse. He \u201cdismissed the DNA evidence as [in]valid\u201d and\nasserted the victim and witness statements were incorrect and the victim\u2019s mother \u201cgot\neverybody to go against\u201d him. Ultimately, the evaluating doctor determined that\nDefendant\u2019s risk for engaging in sexual misconduct was \u201cwell above average[.]\u201d\n\n      Brandi Donaldson, Defendant\u2019s sister, testified that she had witnessed the victim\nconsume alcohol, smoke marijuana, and make sexual advances on grown men. Ms.\n                                              -5-\n\fDonaldson stated that Defendant is \u201ca really good person\u201d who had not been given the\nchance he needs and \u201cfalls victim to trying to fit in and do what other people want from\nhim.\u201d Defendant introduced five certificates of completion for behavioral and Bible classes\nhe had obtained while incarcerated.\n\n       The trial court stated that it had considered the evidence at the sentencing hearing,\nthe presentence report, the principles of sentencing and arguments on sentencing\nalternatives, the nature of the criminal conduct, evidence regarding mitigating and\nenhancement factors, statistical information from the administrative office of the courts on\nsentencing and Defendant\u2019s potential for rehabilitation and treatment. It found Defendant\nto be a Range I standard offender and noted that count one was a non-probateable offense\nrequired to be served at 100%. The trial court found that mitigating factor one, that the\ncriminal conduct neither caused nor threatened serious bodily injury, applied but did not\n\u201cput a whole lot of weight on it.\u201d See T.C.A. \u00a7 40-35-113(1).\n\n        Regarding enhancement factors, the trial court \u201cput a great deal of credit\u201d on\nDefendant\u2019s conviction for failure to appear and \u201cextensive, long-term\u201d drug use because\n\u201cthe best predictor of future performances is past behavior[.]\u201d See id. \u00a7 -114(1) (\u201cThe\ndefendant has a previous history of criminal convictions or criminal behavior, in addition\nto those necessary to establish the appropriate range[.]\u201d). It also applied enhancement\nfactor seven, that the crime was committed to gratify Defendant\u2019s desire for pleasure and\nexcitement. See id. \u00a7 -114(7). The court noted that Defendant was in a sexual relationship\nwith the victim\u2019s mother, \u201ca willing sex partner that\u2019s more your age[,]\u201d when he undertook\nthis sexual relationship with \u201cthis child\u201d and ejaculated during the sexual encounter. Based\non Defendant\u2019s two prior probation violations, the trial court found that Defendant had\nfailed to comply with the conditions of a sentence involving release into the community.\nSee id. \u00a7 -114(8). Finally, the trial court found that Defendant violated a position of private\ntrust because Defendant was \u201cinvolved in a parental role for this child\u201d and the victim\u2019s\nmother \u201ctrusted [Defendant] enough to have him in the house\u201d with her children. See id.\n\u00a7 -114(14).\n\n        The trial court sentenced Defendant to eleven years for count one and four years\neach for counts eight through thirteen. After considering the \u201caggravating circumstances,\u201d\nit found that partial consecutive sentencing was appropriate because Defendant was\nconvicted of more than two offenses involving sexual abuse of a minor. See id. \u00a7 40-35-\n115(a)(5). It ordered that counts nine and ten be served consecutively to count one, and\nthat eight, eleven, twelve, and thirteen run concurrently with each other but consecutively\nto counts one, nine, and ten, for an effective sentence of twenty-three years.\n\n       On March 21, 2022, the trial court entered a written order containing its oral\nfindings. Defendant filed a timely motion for new trial on April 20, 2022, which was\n                                             -6-\n\fsubsequently amended on May 8, 2023. The trial court denied Defendant\u2019s motion for new\ntrial via written order on April 4, 2024.1 Defendant\u2019s timely appeal is now before this\ncourt.\n\n                                               Analysis\n\n                                     I. Admission of Evidence\n\n        On appeal, Defendant argues that the psychosexual evaluation and the victim impact\nstatement were inadmissible hearsay, and their admission at the sentencing hearing violated\nhis rights under the confrontation clause because the authors of the documents did not\ntestify. The State argues that the trial court properly admitted the psychosexual evaluation\nand the victim impact statement. We agree with the State.\n\n        Both the United States and Tennessee constitutions provide criminal defendants the\nright to confront witnesses against them. U.S. Const. amend. VI; Tenn. Const. art. I, \u00a7 9.\n\u201cThe admission of testimonial hearsay at trial, without a showing of unavailability and an\nopportunity to cross-examine, generally violates a defendant\u2019s right to confront adverse\nwitnesses.\u201d State v.

Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 50 (2004)).\nHowever, this court has repeatedly held that \u201cthe Confrontation Clause is not applicable to\nsentencing hearings.\u201d State v. Bonds, 502 S.W.3d 118, 150 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2016) (first\nciting State v. Whited, No. E2013-02523-CCA-R3-CD, 2015 WL 2097843, at *10 (Tenn.\nCrim. App. May 4, 2015), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 506 S.W.3d 416 (Tenn. 2016); then\nciting State v. Boyd, No. W2009-00762-CCA-R3-CD, 2010 WL 1240720, at *8 (Tenn.\nCrim.

Watkins, 362 S.W.3d 530 (Tenn. 2012)). Thus, Defendant\u2019s argument that the\nvictim impact statement and the psychosexual evaluation violated his rights under the\nconfrontation clause are unavailing.\n\n        The Tennessee Rules of Evidence apply at sentencing except that reliable hearsay\n\u201cmay be admitted if the opposing party is accorded a fair opportunity to rebut any hearsay\nevidence so admitted[.]\u201d T.C.A. \u00a7 40-35-209(b). Examples of reliable hearsay include\ncertified copies of convictions or documents and presentence reports. State v. Richmond,\nNo. M2021-01025-CCA-R3-CD, 2022 WL 4372220, at *11 (Tenn. Crim. App. Sept. 22,\n2022) (citing State v. Baker, 956 S.W.2d 8, 17 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1997)), no perm. app.\n\n   1\n     The reasons for the approximate one-year delay between the original and amended motion for new trial\nand the trial court\u2019s entry of a written order denying the motion are unclear from the record. However,\nneither party raises the issue on appeal.\n                                                  -7-\n\ffiled; see Jenkins v. State, E2010-00938-CCA-R3-PC, 2011 WL 810770, at *5 (Tenn.\nCrim. App. Mar. 9, 2011) (concluding that the petitioner could not establish prejudice\nstemming from counsel\u2019s failure to object to admission of the presentence report because\n\u201cit is settled law that the presentence report is reliable hearsay and is admissible during\nsentencing hearings\u201d).\n\n       When a defendant is convicted of a sex offense, which includes aggravated statutory\nrape, and is eligible for an alternative sentence, a psychosexual evaluation \u201cshall be\nincluded as part of the presentence report and shall be considered by the court[.]\u201d T.C.A.\n\u00a7 39-13-705(b) (emphasis added). Additionally, \u201c[p]rior to imposition of sentence in a\nfelony case, the department of correction shall prepare a written victim impact statement\nas part of the presentence report on the defendant.\u201d Id. \u00a7 40-38-205. Thus, both the\npsychosexual evaluation and the victim impact statement were part of the presentence\nreport, and the \u201ctrial court is entitled to rely on the presentence report \u2018absent a showing\nthat the report is based upon unreliable sources or is otherwise inaccurate.\u2019\u201d State v.\nRogers, No. W2021-00807-CCA-R3-CD, 2022 WL 2733698, at *9 (Tenn. Crim. App. July\n14, 2022) (quoting State v. Crossman, No. 01C01-9311-CR-00394, 1994 WL 548712, at\n*6 (Tenn. Crim. App. Oct. 6, 1994)), no perm. app. filed. Because the psychosexual\nevaluation and victim impact statement are not constitutionally prohibited and are\nexplicitly authorized by statute, such evidence is admissible so long as it is reliable, and\nDefendant was provided the opportunity to rebut the evidence. See State v. Moss, 13\nS.W.3d 374, 385 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1999); T.C.A. \u00a7 40-35-209(b).\n\n       The victim impact statement was attached to the presentence report. It included\nboth the Tennessee Department of Correction (\u201cTDOC\u201d) Victim Impact Statement form,\nwhich was filled out, signed, and dated by the victim\u2019s mother and a typed statement from\nthe victim\u2019s mother on a separate page. See Harris, 2009 WL 1871919, at *6 (citing State\nv. Garner, No. M1999-01427-CCA-R3-CD, 2000 WL 1681022, at *3 (Tenn. Crim. App.\nNov. 9, 2000)) (stating that a victim impact statement\u2019s inclusion in the presentence report\noperated to verify the hearsay\u2019s reliability). While the typed statement does not include\nthe victim\u2019s mother\u2019s name or signature, it does include the style of the case and the\nvictim\u2019s mother indicated on the TDOC form to \u201csee attached.\u201d Additionally, the\nsubstance of the typed statement makes clear the victim\u2019s mother wrote the statement. To\nthe extent the written statement included details of the circumstances surrounding the\noffenses, such details explained the impact of Defendant\u2019s crimes on the victim and her\nfamily. We conclude that the victim impact statement was sufficiently reliable and, thus,\nwas properly admitted and considered by the trial court.\n\n       Regarding the psychosexual evaluation, Defendant has presented no evidence that\nthe psychosexual evaluation contained inaccuracies or was otherwise unreliable. We note\nthat Defendant asserts in his brief that \u201cthere is nothing in the record authenticating [the\n                                           -8-\n\fpsychosexual evaluation] as actually being the full, final, and complete document[.]\u201d\nHowever, Defendant did not raise this objection at sentencing or in his motion for new\ntrial. Thus, Defendant has waived any objection to the authenticity of the psychosexual\nevaluation. See Tenn. R. App. P. 36(a) (\u201cNothing in this rule shall be construed as requiring\nrelief be granted to a party responsible for an error or who failed to take whatever action\nwas reasonably available to prevent or nullify the harmful effect of an error.\u201d); State v.\nAvila-Salazar, No. M2023-01649-CCA-R3-CD, 2024 WL 3738647, at *2 (Tenn. Crim.\nApp. Aug. 9, 2024) (stating that a party cannot raise an issue for the first time or change\ntheir argument on appeal), perm. app. denied (Tenn. Jan. 24, 2025). The trial court did not\nerr in admitting and considering the psychosexual evaluation because the right to confront\nwitnesses does not extend to sentencing proceedings, and the trial court was required to\nconsider the psychosexual evaluation in sentencing Defendant for counts eight through\nthirteen.\n\n        Defendant is not entitled to relief on this basis.\n\n                                        II. Enhancement Factors\n\n        Defendant argues that the trial court erred by applying enhancement factors seven\nand fourteen because there was no evidence that the offenses were committed to satisfy\nDefendant\u2019s desire for pleasure and excitement other than the inherent sexual nature of\nDefendant\u2019s crimes or that he abused a position of private trust. 2 The State asserts that the\ntrial court properly applied these factors, and in the alternative, any error was harmless\nbecause the trial court imposed a within-range sentence after applying two unchallenged\nenhancement factors. We agree with the State.\n\n       On appeal, the party challenging the sentence bears the burden of establishing that\nthe sentence is improper. State v. Branham, 501 S.W.3d 577, 595 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2016).\nThis court reviews sentencing decisions under an \u201cabuse of discretion standard of review,\ngranting a presumption of reasonableness to within-range sentencing decisions that reflect\na proper application of the purposes and principles of our Sentencing Act.\u201d State v. Bise,\n380 S.W.3d 682, 707 (Tenn. 2012). \u201cA trial court abuses its discretion when it applies\nincorrect legal standards, reaches an illogical conclusion, bases its ruling on a clearly\nerroneous assessment of the proof, or applies reasoning that causes an injustice to the\ncomplaining party.\u201d State v. Phelps, 329 S.W.3d 436, 443 (Tenn. 2010) (citing State v.\nJordan, 325 S.W.3d 1, 38-40 (Tenn. 2010)).\n\n\n   2\n     In his brief, Defendant directs this court\u2019s attention to enhancement factors seven and fourteen but fails\nto include proper citation to the applicable statute or any case law in support of his position. While\nDefendant\u2019s omission has not frustrated this court\u2019s review, we reiterate the importance of including proper\nauthority in support of legal arguments. See Tenn. R. App. P. 27(a)(7)(a); Tenn. Ct. Crim. App. 10(b).\n                                                    -9-\n\f       Once a trial court determines the appropriate range of punishment, the trial court\nmust consider: (1) the evidence received at trial and the sentencing hearing; (2) the\npresentence report, including a validated risk and needs assessment; (3) any arguments as\nto sentencing alternatives; (4) the nature and characteristics of the criminal conduct; (5)\nany applicable mitigating and enhancement factors; (6) any statement the defendant makes\non his behalf; and (7) statistical information provided by the administrative office of the\ncourts as to sentencing practices for similar offenses in Tennessee. T.C.A. \u00a7 40-35-210(a),\n(b). Additionally, the sentence imposed should be \u201cno greater than that deserved for the\noffense committed\u201d and \u201cthe least severe measure necessary to achieve the purposes for\nwhich the sentence was imposed.\u201d Id. at \u00a7 40-35-103(2), (4).\n\n       When adjusting the length of a sentence within the appropriate range, a trial court\nis guided by, but not bound by, any applicable mitigating and enhancement factors. State\nv. Mosley, No. W2022-01424-CCA-R3-CD, 2024 WL 1406156, at *21 (Tenn. Crim. App.\nApr. 2, 2024) (quoting Bise, 380 S.W.3d at 706), perm. app. denied (Tenn. July 17, 2024).\nIt is within the trial court\u2019s sound discretion to weigh any applicable mitigating or\nenhancement factors. State v. Nelson, No. M2023-00176-CCA-R3-CD, 2024 WL\n1192985, at *15 (Tenn. Crim. App. Mar. 20, 2024) (quoting State v. Carter, 254 S.W.3d\n335, 345 (Tenn. 2007)), no perm. app. filed. Thus, \u201ca trial court\u2019s misapplication of an\nenhancement or mitigating factor does not invalidate the sentence imposed unless the trial\ncourt wholly departed\u201d from the sentencing act. Bise, 380 S.W.3d at 706.\n\n        Here, the trial court found that Defendant was a Range I, standard offender. See\nT.C.A. \u00a7 40-35-105. The trial court imposed within-range sentences for each conviction.\nSee id. \u00a7 -112(a)(2), (a)(4) (mandating that a Range I sentence be between eight and twelve\nyears for a Class B felony and between two and four years for a Class D felony).\nAdditionally, the trial court imposed partial consecutive sentencing. See id. \u00a7 -115(a)(5).\nDefendant does not challenge the manner or alignment of his sentences, and thus, this court\nwill focus solely on his challenge to the trial court\u2019s application of enhancement factors\nseven and fourteen.\n\n        Defendant asserts that, in applying enhancement factor seven, the trial court\nimproperly relied on the sexual nature of the offenses. Under Tennessee Code Annotated\nsection 40-35-114(7), a trial court may enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence within the\nappropriate range if it finds that the \u201coffense involved a victim and was committed to\ngratify the defendant\u2019s desire for pleasure or excitement[.]\u201d This factor may not be applied\nto sexual offenses that require proof of motive, such as sexual battery, but may be applied\nto sexual offenses that require no proof of motive, such as rape. State v. Kissinger, 922\nS.W.2d 482, 489-90 (Tenn. 1996) (noting that sexual battery requires proof that the\ndefendant made sexual contact, which is defined as intentional touching \u201cfor the purpose\nof sexual arousal or gratification\u201d). Neither especially aggravated sexual exploitation nor\n                                           - 10 -\n\faggravated statutory rape require proof of motive. See T.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 39-13-506(a), -17-\n1005(a), -17-1002(10).\n\n       \u201cEssential to proper application of this factor is the determination of the defendant\u2019s\nmotive for committing the offense.\u201d State v. Osborne, 251 S.W.3d 1, 26 (Tenn. Crim. App.\n2007) (citing State v. Arnett, 49 S.W.3d 250, 261 (Tenn. 2001)). The State must provide\n\u201cobjective evidence of the defendant\u2019s motivation to seek pleasure or excitement\u201d which\nmay include evidence of \u201csexually explicit remarks and overt sexual displays made by the\ndefendant, such as fondling or kissing a victim or otherwise behaving in a sexual\nmanner[.]\u201d State v. Tice, No. M2021-00495-CCA-R3-CD, 2022 WL 2800876, at *52\n(Tenn. Crim. App. July 18, 2022) (quoting Arnett, 49 S.W.3d at 262), perm. app. denied\n(Tenn. Dec. 14, 2022). The fact that the defendant orgasmed is insufficient, without more,\nto prove the existence of this factor. Kissinger, 922 S.W.2d at 491. \u201cThus, while this factor\ncan apply in a sexual offense, it must be shown that the circumstances surrounding the\noffense go beyond that which one would normally associate with sexual acts.\u201d State v.\nAllen, No. M2005-02808-CCA-R3-CD, 2006 WL 2380613, at *4 (Tenn. Crim. App. Aug.\n16, 2006).\n\n        Here, the trial court applied enhancement factor seven, finding that Defendant\nejaculated during the events and was in a relationship with the victim\u2019s mother. It\nexpressed confusion as to why Defendant entered a sexual relationship with the victim\ndespite having a consensual sexual relationship with the victim\u2019s mother. Further, the trial\ncourt considered the presentence report which established that the victim had told her sister\nthat she and Defendant had sex \u201ctoo many times to count,\u201d Defendant would \u201ctouch her\nbody all over before they had sex (breasts, legs, vagina),\u201d and Defendant told the victim he\nloved her and wanted to marry and have children with her. The victim also reported that\nafter she and Defendant had sex, he would insert his finger into her vagina. See State v.\nYelton, No. E2018-01436-CCA-R3-CD, 2019 WL 2475171, at *8 (Tenn. Crim. App. June\n13, 2019) (affirming application of enhancement factor seven because the \u201cevidence\npresented at trial and in the presentence report established that the [d]efendant kissed the\nvictim, fondled her breasts and buttocks, and inserted his finger into her vagina\u201d). The\nvictim\u2019s fifteen-year-old sister described when Defendant and the victim \u201cwere making a\nbet\u201d about whether the victim\u2019s sister would sleep with Defendant, a separate incident\nwhen Defendant sexually assaulted the victim\u2019s sister, and another incident when\nDefendant again propositioned the victim\u2019s minor sister, all of which support a finding that\nDefendant sought sexual interactions from the young girls to satisfy his desire for pleasure\nand excitement. The evidence supports the trial court\u2019s application of enhancement factor\nseven.\n\n       Next, Defendant contends that the trial court erred by applying enhancement factor\nfourteen. He notes that the State ultimately dismissed counts two through seven, and thus,\n                                            - 11 -\n\fDefendant \u201cdid not admit, even through virtue of his guilty plea, that he abused a position\nof public or private trust.\u201d Under Tennessee Code Annotated section 40-35-114(14), a trial\ncourt may enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence if the defendant abused a position of private trust\nin the commission of the offense. \u201c[A]pplication of the factor requires a finding, first, that\ndefendant occupied a position of trust\u201d and then a determination of \u201cwhether the position\noccupied was abused by the commission of the offense.\u201d Kissinger, 922 S.W.2d at 488.\nThe position of private trust is dependent on the nature of the relationship, not on the\nformality, and our supreme court has noted that the positions of \u201cparent, step-parent,\nbabysitter, teacher, [and] coach\u201d are a few \u201cobvious examples.\u201d Id. An adult who lives\nwith a minor \u201coccupies a position of \u2018presumptive private trust\u2019 with respect to the minor.\u201d\nState v. Gutierrez, 5 S.W.3d 641, 645 (Tenn. 1999).\n\n       Here, the trial court found that Defendant abused a position of private trust because\nDefendant told law enforcement that he occupied a \u201cparental role\u201d for the victim. The trial\ncourt further noted that Defendant lived in the home with the victim, dated and engaged in\na sexual relationship with the victim\u2019s mother, and the victim\u2019s mother \u201ctrusted him to\nleave the [victim] alone with him.\u201d These findings are more than adequately supported by\nthe record, particularly the presentence report which noted that Defendant stated that the\nvictim \u201clooked up to him,\u201d as well as the victim\u2019s sister\u2019s statement about the length of\ntime the family had known Defendant. See Kissinger, 922 S.W.2d at 489 (finding that the\ndefendant occupied a position of private trust because he had a long friendship with the\nvictims\u2019 mother and the victims\u2019 mother trusted him with the care of the boys); State v.\nChaves-Abrego, No. M2019-01686-CCA-R3-CD, 2021 WL 50252, at *9 (Tenn. Crim.\nApp. Jan. 6, 2021) (upholding trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant \u201cwas in a position of\nprivate trust with the victims\u2019 parents and that he abused that position of private trust\u201d\nwithout regard to whether the defendant was in a position of private trust with the minor\nvictims). The evidence supports the trial court\u2019s application of enhancement factor\nfourteen.\n\n        Finally, we note that even had we determined that the trial court erred in the\napplication of either or both enhancement factors discussed above, the trial court applied\ntwo other enhancement factors Defendant does not challenge. See State v. Ambrose, No.\nM2023-00097-CCA-R3-CD, 2024 WL 3596231, at *10 (Tenn. Crim. App. July 31, 2024)\n(citing State v. Dotson, 450 S.W.3d 1, 103 (Tenn. 2014)) (noting that \u201cthe application of a\nsingle enhancement factor supports an enhanced sentence\u201d), perm. app. denied (Tenn.

City of Portland, 306 Or 444, 448,\n760 P2d 252 (1988); Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers, 287 Or at\n602-03. In Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers, the court described\ncharacteristics that identify an adjudicative action:\n      \u201cGenerally, to characterize a process as an adjudication pre-\n      supposes that the process is bound to result in a decision and\n      that the decision is bound to apply preexisting criteria to con-\n      crete facts. * * * [A] further consideration has been whether\n      the action, even when the governing criteria leave much room\n      for policy discretion, is directed at a closely circumscribed\n      factual situation or a relatively small number of persons.\u201d\nId.\n        Our caselaw has come to recognize Strawberry Hill\n4 Wheelers as identifying three considerations that bear on\nthe determination whether a local government\u2019s process is\nadjudicative and therefore subject to a writ of review:\n     \u2022   Does the process, once begun, call for reaching a deci-\n         sion confined by preexisting criteria rather than by a\n         wide discretionary choice of action or inaction?\n     \u2022   To what extent is the decision-maker bound to apply\n         preexisting criteria to concrete facts?\n     \u2022   To what extent is the decision directed at a closely cir-\n         cumscribed factual situation or a relatively small num-\n         ber of persons?\nDodds, 222 Or App at 133 (noting that, in Strawberry Hill 4\nWheelers, \u201cthe Supreme Court explained that quasi-judicial\n\fCite as 339 Or App 27 (2025)                                                   31\n\ndecisions subject to writ of review are those processes that\nmeet three criteria\u201d); see also Hood River Valley v.

The\nthree considerations do not describe fixed elements of a quasi-\njudicial function but \u201ccharacteristics that might indicate that\na disputed action or decision-making process was judicial or\nquasi-judicial, as opposed to ministerial or legislative.\u201d Lane,\n310 Or App at 303-04 (quoting Hicks v. Central Point Sch. Dist.,\n270 Or App 532, 544, 348 P3d 307, rev den, 357 Or 743 (2015)).\nIf the writ-of-review process is available, the writ-of-review\nstatutes bar claims for declaratory or injunctive relief. ORS\n34.102 (stating that, if a writ of review is available, then the\ndecision must be reviewed under ORS 34.010 to ORS 34.102).\n         The determination whether the writ of review\nprocess was available here depends on whether the city\u2019s\naction was adjudicative, within the meaning of the term as\ndescribed in Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers. We therefore con-\nsider in more detail the largely undisputed facts giving rise\nto the current dispute.\n          It is undisputed that plaintiffs requested a permit\nfor the remodel of the ground-level commercial space of 1448\n28th Avenue. The materials submitted by plaintiffs did not\nrefer to a driveway and, on the submitted drawings, the area\nwhere the driveway curb cut sits was labeled \u201cwood fence.\u201d\n         The record shows that the city\u2019s actions consisted\nof the following: As required by Title 17 of the Portland\nCity Code (PCC), plaintiffs\u2019 application was reviewed by the\nPortland Bureau of Development Services (BDS) and Bureau\nof Transportation (PBOT). The review revealed a driveway\nand curb cut on plaintiffs\u2019 site and adjacent to the side of\nplaintiffs\u2019 building that did not comply with the PCC.1 In\n   1\n     PCC 17.28.110 provides, as relevant:\n       \u201cA. Purpose. Ensure that driveway locations promote the safe and\n   orderly flow of pedestrians, bicycles, and vehicular traffic, preserve on-street\n   parking, preserve or establish street trees, maximize opportunities for veg-\n   etated stormwater management, reduce conflicts with pedestrians and bicy-\n   cles and enhance the pedestrian environment.\n       \u201c* * * * *\n       \u201cC. Driveway definition: For the purposes of this Code section, a drive-\n   way is a gravel or paved way for vehicular traffic extending from the roadway\n\f32                      1448 28th Avenue, LLC v. City of Portland\n\nparticular, the driveway was closer than 25 feet from the\nintersection of NE 28th Avenue and NE Halsey Avenue.\nIt did not permit vehicles to exit in a forward motion, as\nrequired by the PCC for NE 28th Avenue, a \u201ccollector\u201d street.\nIn addition, the driveway was \u201ctoo narrow for modern vehic-\nular circulation under Portland City Code Requirements,\u201d\nhad a \u201cblind corner nearby,\u201d and was adjacent to \u201can inter-\nsection that has known safety problems\u201d and a \u201chistory of\ntraffic crashes going back many years.\u201d In fact, the driveway\ndid not meet the PCC definition of a \u201cdriveway,\u201d because it\ndid not access parking. Indeed, plaintiffs\u2019 application did not\neven identify the driveway; the curb cut area was labeled as\na \u201cwood fence.\u201d\n          Because plaintiffs\u2019 driveway was in violation of the\nPCC, plaintiffs\u2019 building-permit application triggered the\ncity to require either the removal or modification of the drive-\nway. Plaintiffs could have challenged the city\u2019s determina-\ntion through a driveway-design exception but they chose not\nto do so. And plaintiffs were not interested in attempting\nto modify the driveway. Instead, plaintiffs agreed to add a\ncurb to close the driveway. They completed an application\nfor a \u201cminor improvement permit,\u201d which allows them to add\na curb, so that the permitting process could continue. With\nthe addition of a curb as a condition, the city approved a per-\nmit for the remodel.\n        Several months later, plaintiffs sought a final occu-\npancy permit. But plaintiffs had not constructed the curb to\n     to the adjacent property line(s) for the purpose of providing access to parking\n     as provided under PCC Chapter 33.266.\n         \u201cD. Reconstruction and Revocation of Existing Driveways.\n         \u201c1. The Director of the Bureau of Transportation may revoke any drive-\n     way permit or require the modification of any driveway if:\n         \u201ca. The area occupied by the driveway is needed for right-of-way pur-\n     poses; or\n         \u201cb. Continued operation of the driveway interferes with the safe and\n     orderly flow of pedestrians, bicycles or vehicular traffic; or\n         \u201cc. The abutting owner has failed to comply with all specifications and\n     conditions of the permit; or\n         \u201cd. The driveway does not access a legal parking space on abutting prop-\n     erty per PCC Title 33.\n         \u201c2. The Council may revoke any driveway permit if it deems such action\n     will be in the public interest.\u201d\n\fCite as 339 Or App 27 (2025)                                      33\n\nclose the driveway, as permitted by the minor improvement\npermit. As a result, the city denied the request for a final\noccupancy permit, citing the permit\u2019s condition for removal\nof the driveway. In a letter to plaintiffs\u2019 legal counsel, the\ncity attorney explained:\n   \u201cThe applicant acquired a minor improvement permit to close\n   the driveway with this remodel work as a condition of PBOT\n   approving the building permit. This driveway closure con-\n   tinues to be required and final occupancy will not be issued\n   until such time as this driveway is permanently closed.\u201d\n         Plaintiffs objected, contending that the \u201chistoric res-\nidential driveway\u201d should not even have come into consider-\nation, because its use was only by the second-floor residential\nspace, which was not implicated by the remodeled ground-\nlevel commercial space. The city responded that it does not\nmatter which portion of the structure is being remodeled or\nwhether the space is commercial or residential\u2014the city\u2019s\nfocus for the driveway requirement is on the site, not the var-\nious uses of the site. And the city explained that, although\nthe city has authority under the PCC to require the removal\nor upgrade of any nonconforming driveway at any time (even\none that is \u201chistoric\u201d), its policy is to wait until a permit is\nsought for a development of the property before requiring an\nupgrade or removal of a nonconforming driveway.\n         Plaintiffs disagreed and chose to file this declar-\natory judgment action, which, as noted, the trial court\nrejected, concluding that it lacked jurisdiction. Plaintiffs\u2019\nprimary arguments under their single assignment of error\nare that the actions of the city on plaintiffs\u2019 permit were not\nquasi-judicial under the Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers criteria\nand, further, that the \u201chistoric residential driveway\u201d was\nnot implicated by the remodel of the commercial space.\n         The city responds that the city\u2019s decision to decline\nto issue the permanent occupancy permit until the driveway\nis removed falls within the quasi-judicial category described\nin Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers, and we agree.\n        We address each of the criteria.\n        Does the process, once begun, call for reaching a\ndecision confined by preexisting criteria rather than by a\n\f34                      1448 28th Avenue, LLC v. City of Portland\n\nwide discretionary choice of action or inaction? Plaintiffs\nrequested a final certificate of occupancy. The request would\neither be approved or denied and was thus bound to result in\na decision. And the city\u2019s decision to deny the request pend-\ning removal of the driveway was confined by preexisting cri-\nteria\u2014those rules set forth in the PCC relating to noncon-\nforming driveways and established city policy that upgrades\nto or removal of nonconforming driveways would be required\nupon application for development of a property.\n         To what extent is the decision-maker bound to apply\npreexisting criteria to concrete facts? The undisputed record\nshows that the city has fixed procedures and criteria that it\napplies in evaluating development permits and that, in mak-\ning the decision that plaintiffs were required to remove the\ndriveway before a final certificate of occupancy would be\nissued, the city applied those preexisting criteria, including\nthe rules set forth in the PCC. The undisputed record further\nshows that, in making the decision that the driveway must\nbe removed, the city made its determination based on undis-\nputed concrete facts.\n         To what extent is the decision directed at a closely\ncircumscribed factual situation or a relatively small number\nof persons? Plaintiffs concede that the city\u2019s decision was\ndirected at a closely circumscribed factual situation and a\nrelatively small number of persons.\n         The considerations identified by the Supreme Court\nin Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers each weigh in favor of a deter-\nmination that the city\u2019s action was \u201cadjudicative\u201d or quasi-\njudicial. The record further persuades us that the city\u2019s\naction falls within the adjudicative or quasi-judicial category\ndescribed in Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers and was therefore\nsubject to writ of review. For that reason, we conclude that\nthe trial court did not err in determining that it lacked juris-\ndiction to consider plaintiffs\u2019 declaratory judgment action.2\n           Affirmed.\n\n     2\n       Because we conclude that the trial court did not err in dismissing plaintiffs\u2019\ndeclaratory judgment claim for lack of jurisdiction, we need not address plain-\ntiffs\u2019 argument that the remodel of the commercial space did not implicate the\n\u201chistoric residential driveway.\u201d\n\f",

ORS\n34.102 (stating that, if a writ of review is available, then the\ndecision must be reviewed under ORS 34.010 to ORS 34.102).\n         The determination whether the writ of review\nprocess was available here depends on whether the city\u2019s\naction was adjudicative, within the meaning of the term as\ndescribed in Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers. We therefore con-\nsider in more detail the largely undisputed facts giving rise\nto the current dispute.\n          It is undisputed that plaintiffs requested a permit\nfor the remodel of the ground-level commercial space of 1448\n28th Avenue. The materials submitted by plaintiffs did not\nrefer to a driveway and, on the submitted drawings, the area\nwhere the driveway curb cut sits was labeled \u201cwood fence.\u201d\n         The record shows that the city\u2019s actions consisted\nof the following: As required by Title 17 of the Portland\nCity Code (PCC), plaintiffs\u2019 application was reviewed by the\nPortland Bureau of Development Services (BDS) and Bureau\nof Transportation (PBOT). The review revealed a driveway\nand curb cut on plaintiffs\u2019 site and adjacent to the side of\nplaintiffs\u2019 building that did not comply with the PCC.1 In\n   1\n     PCC 17.28.110 provides, as relevant:\n       \u201cA. Purpose. Ensure that driveway locations promote the safe and\n   orderly flow of pedestrians, bicycles, and vehicular traffic, preserve on-street\n   parking, preserve or establish street trees, maximize opportunities for veg-\n   etated stormwater management, reduce conflicts with pedestrians and bicy-\n   cles and enhance the pedestrian environment.\n       \u201c* * * * *\n       \u201cC. Driveway definition: For the purposes of this Code section, a drive-\n   way is a gravel or paved way for vehicular traffic extending from the roadway\n\f32                      1448 28th Avenue, LLC v. City of Portland\n\nparticular, the driveway was closer than 25 feet from the\nintersection of NE 28th Avenue and NE Halsey Avenue.\nIt did not permit vehicles to exit in a forward motion, as\nrequired by the PCC for NE 28th Avenue, a \u201ccollector\u201d street.\nIn addition, the driveway was \u201ctoo narrow for modern vehic-\nular circulation under Portland City Code Requirements,\u201d\nhad a \u201cblind corner nearby,\u201d and was adjacent to \u201can inter-\nsection that has known safety problems\u201d and a \u201chistory of\ntraffic crashes going back many years.\u201d In fact, the driveway\ndid not meet the PCC definition of a \u201cdriveway,\u201d because it\ndid not access parking. Indeed, plaintiffs\u2019 application did not\neven identify the driveway; the curb cut area was labeled as\na \u201cwood fence.\u201d\n          Because plaintiffs\u2019 driveway was in violation of the\nPCC, plaintiffs\u2019 building-permit application triggered the\ncity to require either the removal or modification of the drive-\nway. Plaintiffs could have challenged the city\u2019s determina-\ntion through a driveway-design exception but they chose not\nto do so. And plaintiffs were not interested in attempting\nto modify the driveway. Instead, plaintiffs agreed to add a\ncurb to close the driveway. They completed an application\nfor a \u201cminor improvement permit,\u201d which allows them to add\na curb, so that the permitting process could continue. With\nthe addition of a curb as a condition, the city approved a per-\nmit for the remodel.\n        Several months later, plaintiffs sought a final occu-\npancy permit. But plaintiffs had not constructed the curb to\n     to the adjacent property line(s) for the purpose of providing access to parking\n     as provided under PCC Chapter 33.266.\n         \u201cD.

The area occupied by the driveway is needed for right-of-way pur-\n     poses; or\n         \u201cb. Continued operation of the driveway interferes with the safe and\n     orderly flow of pedestrians, bicycles or vehicular traffic; or\n         \u201cc.

As a result, the city denied the request for a final\noccupancy permit, citing the permit\u2019s condition for removal\nof the driveway. In a letter to plaintiffs\u2019 legal counsel, the\ncity attorney explained:\n   \u201cThe applicant acquired a minor improvement permit to close\n   the driveway with this remodel work as a condition of PBOT\n   approving the building permit. This driveway closure con-\n   tinues to be required and final occupancy will not be issued\n   until such time as this driveway is permanently closed.\u201d\n         Plaintiffs objected, contending that the \u201chistoric res-\nidential driveway\u201d should not even have come into consider-\nation, because its use was only by the second-floor residential\nspace, which was not implicated by the remodeled ground-\nlevel commercial space. The city responded that it does not\nmatter which portion of the structure is being remodeled or\nwhether the space is commercial or residential\u2014the city\u2019s\nfocus for the driveway requirement is on the site, not the var-\nious uses of the site. And the city explained that, although\nthe city has authority under the PCC to require the removal\nor upgrade of any nonconforming driveway at any time (even\none that is \u201chistoric\u201d), its policy is to wait until a permit is\nsought for a development of the property before requiring an\nupgrade or removal of a nonconforming driveway.\n         Plaintiffs disagreed and chose to file this declar-\natory judgment action, which, as noted, the trial court\nrejected, concluding that it lacked jurisdiction. Plaintiffs\u2019\nprimary arguments under their single assignment of error\nare that the actions of the city on plaintiffs\u2019 permit were not\nquasi-judicial under the Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers criteria\nand, further, that the \u201chistoric residential driveway\u201d was\nnot implicated by the remodel of the commercial space.\n         The city responds that the city\u2019s decision to decline\nto issue the permanent occupancy permit until the driveway\nis removed falls within the quasi-judicial category described\nin Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers, and we agree.\n        We address each of the criteria.\n        Does the process, once begun, call for reaching a\ndecision confined by preexisting criteria rather than by a\n\f34                      1448 28th Avenue, LLC v. City of Portland\n\nwide discretionary choice of action or inaction? Plaintiffs\nrequested a final certificate of occupancy. The request would\neither be approved or denied and was thus bound to result in\na decision. And the city\u2019s decision to deny the request pend-\ning removal of the driveway was confined by preexisting cri-\nteria\u2014those rules set forth in the PCC relating to noncon-\nforming driveways and established city policy that upgrades\nto or removal of nonconforming driveways would be required\nupon application for development of a property.\n         To what extent is the decision-maker bound to apply\npreexisting criteria to concrete facts? The undisputed record\nshows that the city has fixed procedures and criteria that it\napplies in evaluating development permits and that, in mak-\ning the decision that plaintiffs were required to remove the\ndriveway before a final certificate of occupancy would be\nissued, the city applied those preexisting criteria, including\nthe rules set forth in the PCC. The undisputed record further\nshows that, in making the decision that the driveway must\nbe removed, the city made its determination based on undis-\nputed concrete facts.\n         To what extent is the decision directed at a closely\ncircumscribed factual situation or a relatively small number\nof persons? Plaintiffs concede that the city\u2019s decision was\ndirected at a closely circumscribed factual situation and a\nrelatively small number of persons.\n         The considerations identified by the Supreme Court\nin Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers each weigh in favor of a deter-\nmination that the city\u2019s action was \u201cadjudicative\u201d or quasi-\njudicial. The record further persuades us that the city\u2019s\naction falls within the adjudicative or quasi-judicial category\ndescribed in Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers and was therefore\nsubject to writ of review. For that reason, we conclude that\nthe trial court did not err in determining that it lacked juris-\ndiction to consider plaintiffs\u2019 declaratory judgment action.2\n           Affirmed.\n\n     2\n       Because we conclude that the trial court did not err in dismissing plaintiffs\u2019\ndeclaratory judgment claim for lack of jurisdiction, we need not address plain-\ntiffs\u2019 argument that the remodel of the commercial space did not implicate the\n\u201chistoric residential driveway.\u201d\n\f</pre>",

On the first day of trial, plaintiff,\nappearing pro se, informed the court that he intended to\npursue only the unpaid wages claim and wanted to drop the\nother claims. Trial was held on the unpaid wages claim, and\nthe court sitting as factfinder found in defendant\u2019s favor. All\nclaims were then dismissed with prejudice. Defendant filed\nan attorney fee statement, summarily asserting a right to\nfees and costs under \u201cORS 659A.885(8)(e), ORS 652.200, and\nORS 20.107.\u201d1 Plaintiff made no objection to the fee state-\nment. As part of its general judgment, the court awarded\n$37,343.08 in attorney fees and costs to defendant, which\nwas the full amount requested. The court did not identify\nthe statutory bases for the fee award, nor did it make any\nfindings.\n         On appeal, plaintiff raises three assignments of\nerror, all relating to the fee award. In his first assignment\nof error, plaintiff argues that the court erred in awarding\nfees on the wage claim. He assumes that the court did not\naward fees under the statute cited in the fee statement, ORS\n652.200, because it applies only to prevailing plaintiffs, and\ninstead awarded fees under ORS 20.105\u2014a statute never\nmentioned in the trial court but that provides for a fee award\nin a civil action if there \u201cwas no objectively reasonable basis\nfor asserting the claim\u201d\u2014and argues why it was error to do\nso. In response, defendant argues that it could have been\nawarded fees under ORS 653.055(4), another statute never\nmentioned below. In his second and third assignments of\nerror, plaintiff argues that the court\u2019s findings are inade-\nquate for meaningful appellate review.\n         It is true that the trial court\u2019s findings are inade-\nquate for meaningful appellate review. See Northwest Pump\n& Equipment Co. v. Stach, 167 Or App 64, 69, 1 P3d 466\n(2000) (\u201cWhile Oregon courts have broad discretion in setting\n    1\n      ORS 20.107 and ORS 659A.885(8)(e) pertain to discrimination claims. ORS\n652.200 pertains to claims for unpaid wages upon termination.\n\f224              Abualya v.

It is also true that the\nfee award on the wage claim is potentially problematic, inso-\nfar as the only statute cited as a basis for awarding fees on\nthat claim was a statute that, on its face, did not apply. See\nORS 652.200(1) (requiring fee award if the court \u201center[s]\njudgment for the plaintiff\u201d).\n          Ultimately, however, plaintiff\u2019s failure to object to\nthe fee statement in the trial court proceeding is dispositive.\nORCP 68 C(4)(f) provides, with respect to attorney fee state-\nments, that \u201c[i]f objections are not timely filed, the court may\naward attorney fees or costs and disbursements sought in\nthe statement.\u201d We have previously recognized the discre-\ntionary nature of \u201cmay\u201d and that the trial court may choose\nto independently assess the fee statement even absent objec-\ntions. Moreau v. Samalin, 295 Or App 534, 538, 435 P3d\n794 (2019) (\u201cEven when a fee petition is unopposed, the trial\ncourt may make its own assessment of the reasonableness of\nthe fees. See ORCP 68 C(4)(f); Council on Court Procedures,\nStaff Comment to ORCP 68, 32 (Dec 15, 1990) (the trial court\nhas \u2018discretion to pass on the reasonableness of the amounts\nclaimed,\u2019 even when there is no objection).\u201d). Plaintiff has\nnot developed any argument as to how, given ORCP 68 C(4)\n(f), it was an abuse of discretion to award fees and costs as\nrequested when no objection was filed, or why the court was\nrequired to make any findings under the circumstances. See\nMcCarthy v. Oregon Freeze Dry, Inc., 327 Or 185, 187 & n 2,\n957 P2d 1200 (1998) (explaining that \u201cthe objections of a\nparty who resists a petition for attorney fees play an import-\nant role in framing any issues that are relevant to the court\u2019s\ndecision to award or deny attorney fees\u201d and that \u201c[n]o party\nwill be heard to complain of the absence of a finding by the\ncourt on an issue that the party did not raise\u201d).\n        We therefore reject all three assignments of error,\nbased on the lack of any objection in the trial court, which\nallowed the court the option of simply awarding the full\namount requested without conducting an independent\nanalysis.\n        Affirmed.\n\f",

In his only counseled assignment of error,\npetitioner argues that the post-conviction court erred in\ndenying relief on his claim that trial counsel provided inad-\nequate and ineffective assistance by failing to advise him\nin late 2018, before he accepted a plea deal, that his con-\nduct did not constitute the crime of delivery of a controlled\nsubstance. In two pro se supplemental assignments of error,\npetitioner argues that the court also erred because trial\ncounsel provided inadequate and ineffective assistance by\nfailing to request a continuance at sentencing and because\nthe trial court made a comment during sentencing that was\nprejudicial to petitioner. We reject the pro se supplemental\nassignments of error without written discussion, for both\nprocedural and substantive reasons. As for the counseled\nassignment of error, we affirm for the reasons described\nbelow.\n         In October 2018, petitioner was arrested during a\ntraffic stop. The police searched petitioner\u2019s vehicle after\nthe arrest and found 30 grams of methamphetamine, 88.5\ngrams of heroin, a scale, a handgun, and two notebooks\nappearing to contain drug records. Petitioner was charged\nwith delivery of heroin, delivery of methamphetamine, felon\nin possession of a firearm, second-degree criminal posses-\nsion of a forged instrument, resisting arrest, identity theft,\nand first-degree theft. Two months later, pursuant to a plea\nagreement, he pleaded guilty to delivery of heroin, felon in\npossession of a firearm, and resisting arrest, and the remain-\ning charges were dismissed. After an unsuccessful direct\nappeal, petitioner sought post-conviction relief. He alleged,\namong other things, that trial counsel had provided inad-\nequate and ineffective assistance by failing to advise him\nthat his conduct did not constitute the crime of delivery of a\ncontrolled substance\u2014a claim that rested on the overruling\nof State v. Boyd, 92 Or App 51, 756 P2d 1276, rev den, 307 Or\n77 (1988), by State v. Hubbell, 314 Or App 844, 500 P3d 728\n(2021), aff\u2019d, 371 Or 340, 537 P3d 503 (2023), nearly three\nyears after petitioner pleaded guilty. The post-conviction\ncourt denied relief, and petitioner now appeals.\n\f84                                            Ayala v. Fhuere\n\n         A criminal defendant has the right to adequate and\neffective assistance of counsel under Article I, section 11, of\nthe Oregon Constitution and the Sixth Amendment to the\nUnited States Constitution. Antoine v. Taylor, 368 Or 760,\n767, 499 P3d 48 (2021). A violation of those rights entitles a\npetitioner to post-conviction relief. ORS 138.530(1)(a). Under\nthe Oregon Constitution, to succeed on a claim of inadequate\nassistance, petitioner must establish by a preponderance of\nthe evidence that \u201ccounsel failed to exercise reasonable pro-\nfessional skill and judgment, and that the petitioner suffered\nprejudice as a result.\u201d Johnson v. Premo, 361 Or 688, 699,\n399 P3d 431 (2017). \u201cA functionally equivalent two-element\nstandard governs petitioner\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance\nof counsel under the Sixth Amendment.\u201d Smith v. Kelly, 318\nOr App 567, 568-69, 508 P3d 77 (2022), rev den, 370 Or 822\n(2023).\n         In this case, the crux of petitioner\u2019s claim was that\nhis trial counsel was inadequate and ineffective for failing\nto foresee the change in the law that occurred when Hubbell\noverruled Boyd. He claims that his attorney should have\nforeseen that eventuality in 2018 and advised him accord-\ningly\u2014that is, advised him that, if he were convicted at trial\nof delivery of heroin or methamphetamine, those convictions\nmight be reversed on appeal if he challenged Boyd and we\nor the Supreme Court decided to overturn it, as ultimately\nhappened in Hubbell in 2021. We are unpersuaded.\n         In assessing a claim of inadequate assistance of\ncounsel, we \u201cmust make every effort to evaluate a lawyer\u2019s\nconduct from the lawyer\u2019s perspective at the time, without\nthe distorting effects of hindsight.\u201d Lichau v. Baldwin, 333\nOr 350, 360, 39 P3d 851 (2002). Absent some indication of\nan impending change in the law, defense counsel usually\ncannot be said to have provided inadequate or ineffective\nassistance by advising a defendant in accordance with then-\nexisting law, particularly when there is controlling prece-\ndent on the issue. Miller v. Lampert, 340 Or 1, 15-16, 125 P3d\n1260 (2006). Indeed, even when a legal issue is \u201cunsettled,\u201d\nan inadequate-assistance claim will prevail \u201conly if \u2018the\nstate of the law was so obviously ambiguous that any law-\nyer exercising reasonable professional skill and judgment\n\fCite as 339 Or App 82 (2025)                                85\n\nnecessarily would have seen it.\u2019 \u201d Curry v. Highberger, 326 Or\nApp 259, 264, 531 P3d 702, rev den, 371 Or 511 (2023) (quot-\ning Jackson v. Franke, 369 Or 422, 434, 507 P3d 222 (2022)).\n         In other words, it is not enough that, looking back,\n\u201ccounsel could have made a winning argument.\u201d Hagberg v.\nCoursey, 269 Or App 377, 382, 344 P3d 1118, rev den, 358 Or\n69 (2015). The petitioner must show that \u201cbased on the law\nas it existed at the time of [the petitioner\u2019s proceeding], any\nreasonably competent defense attorney would have made\nthe argument that was ultimately deemed meritorious in\n[a later case].\u201d Id.

New Jersey, 530\nUS 466, 120 S Ct 2348, 147 L Ed 2d 435 (2000), that sen-\ntence enhancement facts must be found by a jury. Similarly,\nin Kelly, 318 Or App at 569-70, we held that the petition-\ner\u2019s counsel did not perform deficiently, given existing law,\nwhere counsel did not foresee in 2015 that the United States\nSupreme Court would hold five years later in Ramos v.\nLouisiana, 590 US 83, 140 S Ct 1390, 206 L Ed 2d 583 (2020),\nthat nonunanimous guilty verdicts are unconstitutional.\n         Returning to the present case, Boyd was decided\nin 1988. It expressly held that a person could be convicted\nof the completed crime of delivery of a controlled substance\nbased on evidence that they possessed a large amount of a\ncontrolled substance with the intent to sell it. Boyd, 92 Or\nApp at 54-55 (so holding, based on our construction of ORS\n475.005(8), which defined \u201cdelivery\u201d to include \u201cattempted\ntransfer\u201d). That was the law for more than 30 years, until\n2021, when we overturned Boyd in Hubbell. Hubbell held that\npossession of a large amount of a controlled substance with\nthe intent to sell it could support a conviction for attempted\ndelivery, but that completed delivery required more. See\n\f86                                                         Ayala v.

In petitioner\u2019s view,\nhad counsel so advised him, he could and would have pro-\nceeded to trial, been convicted of the delivery counts, and\ngotten Boyd overturned on appeal in his own case, result-\ning in the reversal of those convictions (presumably to be\nreplaced with attempted delivery convictions).\n         We are unpersuaded that petitioner\u2019s counsel\u2019s\nreliance on Boyd while advising him in late 2018 reflects a\nfailure to exercise reasonable skill and judgment. Boyd had\nbeen controlling precedent for 30 years at that point, and its\ndemise was sudden. Indeed, even the defendant in Hubbell\ndid not foresee the change in the law\u2014we decided sua sponte\nto re-examine \u201cthe settled rule\u201d of Boyd in Hubbell and\nrequested supplemental briefing toward that end. Hubbell,\n314 Or App at 847; id. at 854 (explaining how we came to\ndecide to revisit Boyd). Controlling for the distorting effect\nof hindsight, we agree with the post-conviction court that\npetitioner\u2019s trial counsel did not fail to exercise reasonable\nprofessional skill and judgment by advising petitioner in a\nmanner consistent with then-existing law and without ref-\nerence to the possibility that Boyd could be overruled in the\nfuture. Accordingly, the post-conviction could did not err in\ndenying relief on the claim at issue.\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n    1\n      The legislature amended the delivery statutes in 2024 to effectively rein-\nstate the Boyd rule.

J.\n         Petitioner appeals the denial of his petition for post-\nconviction relief. In his only counseled assignment of error,\npetitioner argues that the post-conviction court erred in\ndenying relief on his claim that trial counsel provided inad-\nequate and ineffective assistance by failing to advise him\nin late 2018, before he accepted a plea deal, that his con-\nduct did not constitute the crime of delivery of a controlled\nsubstance. In two pro se supplemental assignments of error,\npetitioner argues that the court also erred because trial\ncounsel provided inadequate and ineffective assistance by\nfailing to request a continuance at sentencing and because\nthe trial court made a comment during sentencing that was\nprejudicial to petitioner. We reject the pro se supplemental\nassignments of error without written discussion, for both\nprocedural and substantive reasons. As for the counseled\nassignment of error, we affirm for the reasons described\nbelow.\n         In October 2018, petitioner was arrested during a\ntraffic stop. The police searched petitioner\u2019s vehicle after\nthe arrest and found 30 grams of methamphetamine, 88.5\ngrams of heroin, a scale, a handgun, and two notebooks\nappearing to contain drug records. Petitioner was charged\nwith delivery of heroin, delivery of methamphetamine, felon\nin possession of a firearm, second-degree criminal posses-\nsion of a forged instrument, resisting arrest, identity theft,\nand first-degree theft. Two months later, pursuant to a plea\nagreement, he pleaded guilty to delivery of heroin, felon in\npossession of a firearm, and resisting arrest, and the remain-\ning charges were dismissed. After an unsuccessful direct\nappeal, petitioner sought post-conviction relief. He alleged,\namong other things, that trial counsel had provided inad-\nequate and ineffective assistance by failing to advise him\nthat his conduct did not constitute the crime of delivery of a\ncontrolled substance\u2014a claim that rested on the overruling\nof State v.

State of Oregon\n\n         JACQUOT, J.\n          On appeal from a judgment denying post-conviction\nrelief, petitioner argues that the post-conviction court erred\nwhen it denied relief on his claims of ineffective assistance\nof trial and appellate counsel. Petitioner argues that trial\ncounsel was ineffective in failing to obtain additional police\nrecords regarding similar allegations made by the underage\nvictim against other people, and in failing to request a hear-\ning regarding the use of restraints on petitioner during his\nbench trial. Petitioner also argues that appellate counsel was\nineffective in not assigning error to the use of restraints or\nto the trial court compelling him to appear in prison clothing\nduring trial. We affirm.\n          We review the post-conviction court\u2019s denial of relief\nfor legal error. Green v. Franke, 357 Or 301, 312, 350 P3d 188\n(2015). We are bound by the post-conviction court\u2019s findings\nof historical fact if those findings are supported by the evi-\ndence in the record. Id. To succeed on a claim of inadequate\nassistance of counsel, a petitioner must show (1) that trial\ncounsel failed to exercise reasonable professional skill and\njudgment, and (2) that the petitioner suffered prejudice as\na result. Id. A petitioner may establish prejudice by demon-\nstrating that counsel\u2019s failure \u201ccould have tended to affect\u201d\nthe outcome of the proceedings, meaning more than \u201cmere\npossibility, but less than probability.\u201d Id. at 322-23.\n          In his first assignment of error, petitioner argues that\nthe post-conviction court erred when it denied his claim that\nhis trial counsel was inadequate in not obtaining additional\npolice records about prior similar allegations made by the\nvictim against others. The court denied relief, because coun-\nsel had presented evidence at trial that the victim had made\nprior allegations against others and \u201cvigorously argued these\npoints,\u201d including through an expert witness, and petitioner\ncould not show prejudice, because the records that petitioner\nalleged his trial counsel should have obtained did not contain\nany additional admissible information that was not presented\nat his trial.\n       Petitioner has not put forth any viable legal theory\nunder which the additional unobtained records could have\n\fNonprecedential Memo Op: 339 Or App 185 (2025)              187\n\nbeen admitted or used by trial counsel, nor has he shown\nthat the records contained anything that trial counsel had\nnot argued based upon the evidence that counsel did obtain.\nTherefore, petitioner has not shown that trial counsel\u2019s\nfailure to obtain the additional records could have tended\nto affect the outcome of the proceedings or that the post-\nconviction court erred in determining that trial counsel was\nnot ineffective in not obtaining additional police records.\n          In his second assignment of error, petitioner argues\nthat the post-conviction court erred when it denied his claim\nthat his trial counsel was inadequate in not objecting to the\ntrial court failing to make required findings on the record to\njustify the use of restraints. Upon trial counsel\u2019s request that\npetitioner not be restrained for trial, the trial court deferred\nto the jail\u2019s policy of keeping defendants in restraints during\nbench trials, and it assured petitioner and counsel that the\nrestraints would not impact its determinations in the case.\nThe deputy extended the restraint on petitioner\u2019s right hand\nso that he could write notes to his attorney during the pro-\nceedings. The court also would not allow petitioner to change\ninto civilian clothes.\n         A criminal defendant has the right to be free from\nphysical restraint during their trial, unless the court finds,\non the record, that there is evidence that the defendant poses\n\u201can immediate or serious risk of committing dangerous or\ndisruptive behavior, or * * * a serious risk of escape.\u201d State v.\nMcCright, 282 Or App 692, 700, 386 P3d 141 (2016). To show\nthat counsel was ineffective, a post-conviction petitioner\nmust prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that \u201ctrial\ncounsel\u2019s failure to object to the use of [restraints] without\nan adequate showing that petitioner posed a security risk\nhad a tendency to affect the result of his trial.\u201d Sproule v.\nCoursey, 276 Or App 417, 426, 367 P3d 946, rev den, 359 Or\n777 (2016) (internal quotation marks omitted). There are\nthree foundational types of prejudice that may result from\nerroneous restraint of a defendant during trial: \u201c(1) impinge-\nment on the presumption of innocence and the dignity of\njudicial proceedings; (2) inhibition of the accused\u2019s decision\nwhether to take the stand as a witness; and (3) inhibition of\nthe accused\u2019s consultation with his or her attorney.\u201d State v.\n\f188                           Chavez-Meza v. State of Oregon\n\nWall, 252 Or App 435, 442, 287 P3d 1250 (2012), rev den, 353\nOr 280 (2013). In addressing any potential prejudice from the\nuse of restraints, the question is whether there is a \u201cmaterial\nimpairment\u201d of those three interests. McCright, 282 Or App\nat 700. The concern for prejudice is less so in bench trials\nthan in jury trials, but it is nonetheless present. Id. at 701.\n         Here, the trial court erred because it did not make\nany findings regarding defendant\u2019s behavioral or escape risk,\ninstead relying solely on the jail\u2019s restraint policy. See id. at\n699-700 (trial court must make an independent determina-\ntion about the defendant\u2019s risk and cannot rely solely upon\nthe conclusions of others). However, that is not the issue in\nthis proceeding. The question before the post-conviction court\nwas whether trial counsel was ineffective in failing to request\na hearing or object to the trial court\u2019s failure to make the\nrequired findings, and whether petitioner suffered prejudice\nas a result. The post-conviction court denied relief for several\nreasons: Trial counsel did object to the use of restraints and\nwas repeatedly denied by the trial court; an accommodation\nwas made so that petitioner could take notes during the trial;\npetitioner was \u201cunable to show the use of restraints caused\nhim to appear guilty before the jury,\u201d because it was a bench\ntrial; the trial court repeatedly assured that the restraints\nwould not impact its determination; and petitioner did not\nshow that the restraints affected his ability to communicate\nwith his attorney or participate in the trial.\n        Petitioner has not provided any argument as to\nhow the post-conviction court\u2019s determination reflects legal\nerror. The court considered each of the types of prejudice\nand determined that petitioner did not meet his burden to\nshow that the erroneous restraint had a tendency to affect\nthe verdict, and its factual determinations are supported by\nevidence in the record. See State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Millican,\n138 Or App 142, 147-48, 906 P2d 857 (1995), rev den, 323\nOr 114 (1996) (finding harmless juvenile\u2019s shackling where\nthe juvenile court stated that the restraints \u201cwon\u2019t affect\nthe Court\u2019s view of the evidence here,\u201d and that, based upon\nthis court\u2019s independent review of the evidence, we did not\n\u201cbelieve that the trial court\u2019s credibility determinations\nwere impermissibly skewed\u201d).\n\fNonprecedential Memo Op: 339 Or App 185 (2025)            189\n\n         Regarding petitioner\u2019s argument that trial counsel\nwas ineffective in not preserving the issue of his errone-\nous restraint for appeal, as explained below, petitioner has\nnot shown that he would have succeeded on appeal even if\nthe argument had been preserved. Accordingly, the post-\nconviction court did not err in determining that trial coun-\nsel was not ineffective in failing to further object to the use\nof restraints.\n         Finally, in his third and fourth assignments of error,\npetitioner argues that appellate counsel was ineffective in\nfailing to assign error to the trial court\u2019s lack of findings\nto justify the restraints and to its decision that petitioner\ncould not wear his civilian clothes. To prevail on a claim of\nineffective assistance of appellate counsel, petitioner must\nestablish \u201c(1) that a competent appellate counsel would have\nasserted the claim, and (2) that had the claim of error been\nraised, it is more probable than not that the result would\nhave been different.\u201d Guinn v. Cupp, 304 Or 488, 496, 747\nP2d 984 (1987).\n          We have previously determined that, in a bench\ntrial, an error by the trial court in not making the required\nindividualized findings about a defendant\u2019s risk to justify\nrestraint is harmless, particularly when the trial court\nacknowledges that it will not allow the restraints to impact\nits decision. See, e.g., McCright, 282 Or App at 700; Millican,\n138 Or App at 147-48. Petitioner points to our comment in\nMcCright that when a trial is \u201cessentially, a credibility con-\ntest,\u201d erroneous restraint might not be harmless, as opposed\nto when there are no material factual disputes making \u201cthe\npotential for impermissible subconscious skewing\u201d of the\ntrial court\u2019s factual determinations \u201cnonexistent.\u201d 282 Or\nApp at 701 (internal quotation marks omitted). However, in\nthis posture, under the standard to prevail on a claim of\nineffective assistance of appellate counsel, petitioner must\nshow that it is \u201cmore probable than not\u201d that the claim\nwould have prevailed. Guinn, 304 Or at 496. Although a\ntrial with no factual disputes presents a \u201cnonexistent\u201d risk\nof impermissible subconscious skewing, that does not mean\nthat it is necessarily \u201cmore probable than not\u201d that any risk\ngreater than nonexistent would result in reversal on appeal.\n\f190                                 Chavez-Meza v. State of Oregon\n\nWe cannot say that the trial was solely a \u201ccredibility con-\ntest\u201d in the way that petitioner portrays, seeing as there was\nproof of communication between petitioner and the 12-year-\nold victim, and petitioner admitted to having sexual contact\nwith the victim.1 And, petitioner does not point to anything\nin the record to indicate that the trial court\u2019s credibility\ndeterminations were impermissibly skewed.\n          We do not imply here that, in a bench trial, the\npotential for unconscious bias against a restrained defen-\ndant does not exist, or that erroneous restraint will always\nbe harmless; nor do we downplay the affect that being held\nin restraints has on the presumption of innocence. See\nUnited States v. Sanchez-Gomez, 859 F3d 649, 661 (9th Cir\n2017), vac\u2019d on other grounds, 584 US 381, 138 S Ct 1532,\n200 L Ed 2d 792 (2018) (right against shackling absent indi-\nvidualized assessment of essential state interest applies in\nall proceedings, including bench trials, and \u201crespects our\nfoundational principle that defendants are innocent until\nproven guilty\u201d; courts \u201ccannot delegate this constitutional\nquestion to those who provide security\u201d); People v. Hamlett,\n193 NYS3d 658, 663, 80 Misc 3d 303, 307 (NY Crim Ct 2023)\n(\u201cIt cannot merely be assumed that judges are immune from\nthe prejudice and bias caused by visible shackles. We judges\nare human, and the sight of a defendant in restraints may\nunconsciously influence even a judicial factfinder.\u201d (Internal\nquotation marks omitted.)); People v. Williams, 2016 IL App\n(3d) 130901, \u00b6 30, 53 NE3d 1019, 1027 (2016) (\u201cAlthough the\npossibility of prejudicing the jury is a factor to be considered,\nthe reasons for forbidding shackling are not limited to trials\nby jury.\u201d). But in the posture and given the circumstances of\nthis case, we cannot say that it is more likely than not that\npetitioner would have prevailed on appeal.\n         Petitioner\u2019s argument that appellate counsel was\nineffective in failing to assign error to the trial court\u2019s denial\nof his request to appear in civilian clothing is also unavail-\ning. Petitioner provides no legal authority to show that,\neven had appellate counsel raised the issue on appeal, it\nwould have resulted in a reversal of petitioner\u2019s convictions.\n    1\n      Although petitioner later disputed the veracity of that confession, that\nissue was litigated through appeal unsuccessfully. State v. Chavez-Meza, 301 Or\nApp 373, 374 n 1, 456 P3d 322 (2019), rev den, 366 Or 493 (2020).\n\fNonprecedential Memo Op: 339 Or App 185 (2025)        191\n\nAccordingly, the post-conviction court did not err when it\ndetermined that appellate counsel was not ineffective.\n        Affirmed.\n\f",

Petitioner asserts that he is the biolog-\nical father of A and assigns error to the trial court\u2019s failure\nto determine paternity and to dismiss the guardianship. We\naffirm.\n         As the result of involvement with the Department\nof Human Services (DHS), and with A\u2019s mother\u2019s consent, A\u2019s\nmaternal grandmother became A\u2019s guardian in 2017. At that\ntime, petitioner was incarcerated. In 2022, A\u2019s mother moved\nto terminate the guardianship, a request she later withdrew.\nAfter A\u2019s mother made that motion, petitioner sought to inter-\nvene in the case, asserting that he was A\u2019s biological father. In\nsupport, petitioner alleged that he \u201ccontemporaneously filed\na Petition to Establish Custody, Parenting Time, and Child\nSupport in Jackson County Case No. 22DR20597, and expects\nto have paternity officially be established through that case.\u201d\nThe trial court granted petitioner\u2019s motion to intervene. At\npetitioner\u2019s request, the trial court ordered DNA testing for\nthe purpose of establishing paternity. Petitioner completed\nthe DNA test and filed the results with the court.\n        Petitioner next moved to dismiss the guardian-\nship proceeding, arguing that the result of the DNA testing\ndemonstrated that he was A\u2019s father:\n   \u201cPaternity has been established, and Intervenor is now\n   ready to assume custody of the child and provide for the\n   child\u2019s physical, mental, and emotional needs. It would be\n   in the best interests of the child for her to live with him,\n   and moreover Intervenor\u2019s rights as a parent necessarily\n   trump the interests of the Guardian/Grandparent.\u201d\nThe guardian opposed that request and asserted that pater-\nnity was not \u201cestablished\u201d because A\u2019s mother had been dat-\ning both petitioner and his \u201cbiologically similar\u201d brother at\nthe time A was conceived. Petitioner did not file a motion to\nestablish paternity, nor did he provide the court with the\nresults of the Jackson County case that he averred, in his\ninitial motion to intervene, would establish paternity.\n\f108                                                  Davis v. Deen\n\n       At the hearing on petitioner\u2019s motion to dismiss the\nguardianship, the trial court made several observations:\n       \u201cSo what I have in front of me now is a two-page\u2014it\u2019s a\n   one-and-a-half page motion to dismiss guardianship and a\n   one-page declaration with seven paragraphs, and there is\n   nothing\u2014there\u2019s a reference, the declaration by Mr. Davis\n   in paragraph 4, \u2018My paternity of [A] has been confirmed by\n   a court-ordered DNA test, the results of which are on file\n   with the court,\u2019 but that\u2014that is an evidentiary matter.\n      \u201c* * * * *\n       \u201cThe way Oregon evidence law requires hearings to be\n   conducted is there [are] exhibits and there is testimony, and\n   if there\u2019s an exhibit that is offered into evidence, the exhibit\n   needs to physically be offered, handed to the court clerk,\n   and it needs to be then determined whether or not it meets\n   the requirements of the law of evidence. If it does, the judge\n   is to rule that it\u2019s admitted into evidence. And there\u2019s also\n   testimony, and witnesses are sworn under oath, and they\n   testify, and that\u2019s what happens in judicial determinations.\n      \u201cAnd your motion is to dismiss a guardianship. It\u2019s not\n   a motion to adjudicate paternity that I see, so I\u2014I\u2019m not\n   quite sure procedurally what foundation exists.\u201d\nPetitioner\u2019s counsel responded that the court should take\njudicial notice of the result of the DNA testing that, according\nto petitioner, was already in the court record without other\nparties\u2019 objection. Petitioner further pointed to a statutory\nevidentiary presumption providing that a blood test that\nresults in a \u201ccumulative paternity index of 99 or greater\u201d cre-\nates a \u201cdisputable presumption of paternity.\u201d ORS 109.258. In\nresponse, guardian\u2019s counsel disputed petitioner\u2019s assertion\nthere was no objection to the blood test establishing paternity:\n   \u201cWe object to the paternity, and we don\u2019t think that a DNA\n   test alone in this circumstance is good enough, and we\u2019d be\n   happy to put evidence on if this was a hearing on paternity,\n   which it isn\u2019t.\u201d\nAfter hearing additional argument, the court ruled:\n       \u201cJudges are limited to making decisions based on what\n   is in front of the judge in a given case, in a given court\n   proceeding. What is in front of this court at this time is the\n   motion of [petitioner] to dismiss guardianship. * * *\n\fCite as 339 Or App 106 (2025)                                                109\n\n        \u201cThis court finds that a foundational requirement for\n    the court even to consider this matter is the establishment\n    of paternity. This court finds that paternity has not been\n    formally established. This court finds that a motion to\n    dismiss guardianship is not a proper procedural forum in\n    Coos County to pursue a determination of whether or not\n    there is paternity for [petitioner].\n        \u201cThat\u2019s particularly true because another proceeding is\n    now occurring in another circuit court in another county\n    in Oregon, specifically Jackson County, and under well-\n    established legal principles, where one proceeding is going\n    forward, a judge in another county can\u2019t simply jump in\n    and make determinations particularly where the motion to\n    determine paternity is not implicitly involved in a motion\n    to dismiss a guardianship.\u201d\nThe court denied the motion to dismiss, as well as petition-\ner\u2019s subsequent motion to reconsider. This appeal followed.\n         On appeal, petitioner argues that the trial court\nerred by not determining that petitioner established paternity\nof A and also erred in denying petitioner\u2019s motion to dismiss\nthe guardianship. In his first assignment of error, petitioner\nrenews the arguments he made below; that, pursuant to ORS\n109.258, the DNA test itself established paternity. Deferring\nto the trial court\u2019s factual findings that are supported by evi-\ndence in the record, we review the trial court\u2019s legal conclu-\nsions for legal error. Caswell v. Day Law and Associates, P. C.,\n309 Or App 367, 375, 481 P3d 972 (2021); Brown v. MacDonald\nand Associates, LLC, 260 Or App 275, 277, 317 P3d 301 (2013).1\n         The trial court did not err. As the trial court rec-\nognized, petitioner moved to terminate the guardianship,\nnot to establish paternity. Petitioner did not file a motion\nto establish, nor request an evidentiary hearing regarding,\npaternity. See, e.g., State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. L. V., 219 Or\nApp 207, 211, 182 P3d 866 (2008) (explaining that, after\nfather completed court-ordered genetic testing, \u201cDHS moved\nto establish [father\u2019s] legal paternity under ORS 419B.395\nand ORS 109.258\u201d). Rather, petitioner insisted that no such\nefforts were necessary despite the guardian\u2019s objections\n    1\n      Petitioner requests that we review the trial court\u2019s factual findings de novo\npursuant to ORS 19.415, however, the basis upon which we affirm the trial court\ndoes not involve any factual determinations.\n\f110                                                             Davis v. Deen\n\nto paternity. And, despite the court explaining the proper\npath for petitioner to proceed to present evidence regard-\ning paternity, petitioner insisted that no further steps were\nrequired.\n        As we understand petitioner\u2019s argument, he con-\ntends that ORS 109.2582 required that the trial court deter-\nmine, as a matter of law, that petitioner is A\u2019s father. ORS\n109.258, however, contains no such mandate.\n           ORS 109.258 \u201cprovides that, in a paternity adjudica-\ntion, \u2018[a] disputable presumption of paternity is created if one\nor more blood tests [including DNA tests] result in a cumu-\nlative paternity index of 99 or greater.\u2019 \u201d Sause and Schnitzer,\n371 Or 573, 594, 539 P3d 722 (2023) (emphasis added) (quot-\ning ORS 109.258). The statute is intended \u201cto help resolve evi-\ndentiary disputes over the efficacy of blood tests in identify-\ning putative fathers.\u201d Id. at 597. Accordingly, it does not itself\ncreate a proceeding to establish paternity; rather, it dictates\nhow a trial court must view blood tests in such a proceeding.\nSee id. at 598 (\u201cFor a blood test to lead to legal parentage, as\nORS 109.258 contemplates, there must be an adjudication or\nother proceeding.\u201d); see also ORS 109.124 to 109.230 (estab-\nlishing procedures for filiation proceedings, including who\nmay initiate, where proceedings must occur, and contents of\nhearing). To aid a trial court in making a paternity determi-\nnation in those proceedings, ORS 109.258 creates an eviden-\ntiary presumption \u201cthat may or may not lead to a determina-\ntion of legal parentage.\u201d Sause, 371 Or at 597.\n         Petitioner may be correct that, in certain proceed-\nings,3 he would be entitled to an evidentiary presumption of\n    2\n      ORS 109.258 provides:\n        \u201cA disputable presumption of paternity is created if one or more blood\n    tests result in a cumulative paternity index of 99 or greater. If the court\n    or administrator finds that the conclusions of all the experts, as disclosed\n    by the evidence based upon the tests, are that the alleged father is not the\n    father of the child, the question of paternity shall be resolved accordingly. If\n    the experts disagree in their findings or conclusions, the question shall be\n    submitted upon all the evidence.\u201d\n    3\n      We observe that the proceedings contemplated by the chapter containing\nthat evidentiary presumption do not include guardianship proceedings under\nORS chapter 125. ORS 109.252 (\u201cUnless the court or administrator finds good\ncause not to proceed in a proceeding under ORS 25.501 to 25.556, 109.124 to\n109.230 or 419B.609, in which parentage is a relevant fact, the court * * * upon\n\fCite as 339 Or App 106 (2025)                                                111\n\npaternity based on his blood test. A motion to terminate a\nguardianship, however, is not a proceeding to establish par-\nentage. In the absence of such a proceeding, an evidentiary\npresumption does not automatically establish paternity as a\nmatter of law.4\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\nmotion of any party to the action made at a time so as not to delay the proceedings\nunduly shall, order the mother, child, alleged father and any other named respon-\ndent who may be the father to submit to blood tests.\u201d).\n     4\n       Because we conclude that the trial court\u2019s determination that petitioner\nfailed to take the proper procedural steps to establish paternity was sufficient\nto support its decision, we do not address petitioner\u2019s second assignment of error,\nwhich challenges an alternate basis to support the same ruling. See Allianz\nGlobal Risks v. ACE Property & Casualty Ins. Co., 297 Or App 434, 439, 442 P3d\n212 (2019), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 367 Or 711 (2021) (recognizing that an affir-\nmance of a trial court\u2019s ruling on one basis obviates the need to reach arguments\nchallenging alternate bases supporting trial court\u2019s decision). Our disposition\nalso obviates the need to address petitioner\u2019s third assignment of error, which\nrelies on the premise that paternity was established to challenge the denial of the\nmotion to dismiss the guardianship.\n\f",

B. C. B.\n\n        JOYCE, J.\n         In this juvenile dependency case, father appeals\nfrom a judgment of the juvenile court that took jurisdiction\nover his three children. As we explain below, as to the alle-\ngation that jurisdiction was justified because father\u2019s mental\nhealth problems interfere with his ability to safely parent\nthe children, we agree that the evidence was insufficient to\nsupport that basis on which the juvenile court took jurisdic-\ntion. As to the other bases on which the juvenile court took\njurisdiction, having reviewed the record, we conclude that\nthe court did not err. Accordingly, we reverse and remand\nfor entry of a judgment omitting allegation 2(E) as a basis\nfor jurisdiction and otherwise affirm.\n         We review the sufficiency of the evidence support-\ning dependency jurisdiction by \u201cview[ing] the evidence, as\nsupplemented and buttressed by permissible derivative\ninferences, in the light most favorable to the trial court\u2019s\ndisposition and assess[ing] whether, when so viewed, the\nrecord was legally sufficient to permit that outcome.\u201d Dept.\nof Human Services v. N. P., 257 Or App 633, 639, 307 P3d 444\n(2013). \u201cTo establish a basis for juvenile court jurisdiction\nfor purposes of ORS 419B.100(1)(c), the state must prove, by\na preponderance of the evidence, ORS 419B.310(3), that a\nchild\u2019s welfare is endangered because, under the totality of\nthe circumstances, there is a current threat of serious loss\nor injury to the child that is reasonably likely to be real-\nized.\u201d Dept. of Human Services v. K. C. F., 282 Or App 12, 19,\n383 P3d 931 (2016) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n        The juvenile court took jurisdiction over the three\nchildren on several jurisdictional bases:\n  \u2022   Father has exposed the children to domestic violence\n      against mother;\n  \u2022   Father has physically abused the children and caused\n      them emotional distress;\n  \u2022   Father \u201chas mental health issues which impair his\n      judgment and ability to safely parent the children\u201d; and\n  \u2022   Two of the three children are fearful of returning to\n      father\u2019s care.\n\fNonprecedential Memo Op: 339 Or App 176 (2025)              179\n\n         On the record before us, we readily conclude that\nthe juvenile court correctly took jurisdiction on the first two\nbases, involving domestic violence and physical abuse. As\nto the allegation that two of the three children are afraid of\nreturning to father\u2019s care, father argues that there is no evi-\ndence that the two children\u2019s fear of father exposed the third\nchild\u2014who did not share that same fear\u2014to a risk of harm,\nsuch to support taking jurisdiction over the third child on\nthat basis. Whatever merit that argument may have, father\ndid not make that argument to the juvenile court; his argu-\nment is thus unpreserved, and we decline to address it. See\nDept. of Human Services v. C. M., 284 Or App 521, 530-31,\n392 P3d 820 (2017) (rejecting as unpreserved an argument\nthat the evidence was insufficient to support a jurisdictional\nallegation where the parent failed to challenge that basis\nbelow).\n         We reach a different conclusion with respect to\nthe allegation that father\u2019s mental health interferes with\nhis ability to parent. The evidence related to that allega-\ntion came from the testimony of two of the children, who\ndescribed that father \u201cwent a little crazy\u201d at one point,\nsomeone had put a \u201cspell\u201d or \u201chex\u201d on father, and he was\n\u201cseeing things.\u201d It is not apparent from the record that that\nevidence reflects \u201cmental health issues\u201d; to the extent that\nthe court relied on that evidence, without more information\nabout father\u2019s condition, it is insufficient in any event to sup-\nport a conclusion that there is a reasonable risk of harm to\nthe children as a result. See K. C. F., 282 Or App at 19-20\n(the record lacks evidence of the \u201cserious loss or injury to the\nchild that is reasonably likely to be realized\u201d with respect\nto the allegation (internal quotation marks omitted)). We\ntherefore reverse and remand the jurisdictional judgment\nfor the court to enter a judgment omitting allegation 2(E) as\na basis for jurisdiction.\n         Reversed and remanded for entry of judgment omit-\nting allegation 2(E) as a basis for jurisdiction; otherwise\naffirmed.\n\f",

H., 373 Or 26, 48-49, 559 P3d 395 (2024), and\naffirm.\n         We have reviewed the evidence and the juvenile\ncourt\u2019s findings and conclude that the juvenile court cor-\nrectly found that DHS made reasonable efforts and that\nfather had not made sufficient progress to have R return\nhome. In particular, as the juvenile court found, DHS offered\nfather extensive services over several years and father did\nnot engage in those services, save for visits. Although father\nargues that the services were not aimed at ameliorating\nthe single jurisdictional basis\u2014that father \u201cdoes not under-\nstand the basic needs of the child and lacks the skills and/or\nknowledge necessary to safely parent\u201d R\u2014the record reflects\nthat the services were directly related to that jurisdictional\nbasis. Given father\u2019s failure to engage in those services and\ngiven father\u2019s concerning conduct during the single service\nhe did engage in (visits), the juvenile court correctly con-\ncluded that father had not made sufficient progress to enable\nR to return to his care.\n        Affirmed.\n\f",

Plaintiff\nconcedes that we need to address the evidentiary issue only if\nwe agree with plaintiff on the instruction issue. We conclude\nthat the trial court did not err and therefore affirm.\n         Plaintiff brought this negligence action against\ndefendant alleging that she was injured when, as she walked\nout of defendant\u2019s Wood Village store while leaving a voice-\nmail message on her cell phone, she slipped on a three-foot\nby five-foot laminated plastic sign, which had fallen from its\nstand onto the public walkway. Plaintiff alleged that she was\ninjured when she slipped on the sign, causing her right foot\nto slip from underneath her, and her left knee, hand, and\nshoulder to hit the ground. Plaintiff alleged that defendant\nwas negligent in securing the sign, in failing to discover that\nthe sign was on the ground, in failing to barricade the area,\nand in failing to monitor the public entryway of the store.\nPlaintiff sought damages for medical bills of $395,169.02 for\nthree back surgeries and other medical treatments, and for\nfuture projected medical bills of $60,000, and sought non-\neconomic damages of $1,000,000.\n         The sign belonged to defendant\u2019s Starbucks conces-\nsion, which was inside defendant\u2019s store. The Starbucks is\nrun by defendant\u2019s employees. It is undisputed that defen-\ndant\u2019s employees did not place the sign on the ground and\ndid not know that it had fallen out of its frame. Plaintiff did\nnot assert that defendant had constructive knowledge that\nthe sign was on the ground.\n         Plaintiff conceded below that res ipsa loquitur does\nnot apply to typical slip-and-fall claims, which typically\ninvolve substances on a floor that might have been handled\n\f114                                     Fisk v. Fred Meyer Stores, Inc.\n\nby customers. But plaintiff distinguished this claim from\nthose, arguing that plaintiff\u2019s claim was more in the nature\nof a \u201cstandard\u201d \u201cconditions\u201d claim, because the sign was not\na substance or thing normally handled by a customer and\nwas within defendant\u2019s exclusive control. Plaintiff requested\na uniform jury instruction on res ipsa loquitur, contending\nthat the evidence was sufficient to give the jury a rational\nbasis to find that it was more probable than not that defen-\ndant\u2019s failure to exercise reasonable care was the cause of\nthe accident.1 The requested res ipsa loquitur instruction\nstated:\n    \u201cThe law assumes that all persons have obeyed the law and\n    have been free from negligence.\n    \u201cHowever, you may find that the defendant was negligent if\n    you find that the incident that caused damage to the plain-\n    tiff is one that, in the normal course of events, would not\n    have occurred unless the defendant was negligent.\u201d\n\n    1\n      We recently discussed res ipsa loquitur in Jackson v. KA-3 Associates, LLC,\n331 Or App 574, 546 P3d 950, rev allowed, 373 Or 81, 546 P3d 950 (2024):\n         \u201cIn the absence of evidence of negligence or the exact cause of an acci-\n    dent, a factfinder can infer negligence and causation under res ipsa loquitur,\n    a rule of circumstantial evidence, if the \u2018accident is of a kind which ordinarily\n    would not have occurred in the absence of the defendant\u2019s negligence, even\n    though it is impossible to determine the specific way in which the defendant\n    was negligent.\u2019 [Hagler v. Coastal Farm Holdings, Inc., 354 Or 132, 146, 309\n    P3d 1073 (2013)]. The plaintiff bears the burden of submitting evidence that\n    the plaintiff\u2019s injury is of the sort that, more likely than not, was caused by\n    negligence on the part of the defendant and therefore is entitled to an infer-\n    ence of negligence under res ipsa loquitur. Id. Whether a reasonable juror\n    could draw such an inference is an issue of law to be determined by the court.\n    Fieux v. Cardiovascular & Thoracic Clinic, P.C., 159 Or App 637, 640, 978 P2d\n    429, rev den, 329 Or 318 (1999).\n         \u201cIn Ritchie v. Thomas et al., 190 Or 95, 114, 224 P2d 543 (1950), the\n    court explained that res ipsa loquitur is a rule of evidence that allows an\n    inference of negligence, rather than a presumption, under certain limited\n    circumstances:\n         \u201c \u2018[T]he fact of injury alone does not raise an inference of negligence. An\n    inference of negligence may arise only when injury is caused by an instru-\n    mentality which is under the control and management of the defendant, and\n    when the accident is such as, in the ordinary course of events does not hap-\n    pen, if those who have the management use ordinary care.\u2019 \u201d\n331 Or App at 582. See also Kaufman v. Fisher, 230 Or 626, 636-40, 371 P2d 948\n(1962) (describing the question under res ipsa loquitur thusly: \u201cCould it have been\nreasonably found by the jury that the accident which occurred in this case is of\na kind which more probable than not would not have occurred in the absence of\nnegligence upon the part of [the defendant]?\u201d).\n\fCite as 339 Or App 112 (2025)                                    115\n\n        The court declined to give the res ipsa loquitur\ninstruction, explaining,\n   \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a situation for res ipsa because that would\n   require * * * that the sign and the A-frame be in the exclu-\n   sive control or almost exclusive control of the Defendant.\n   And being in a public area like that, * * * I don\u2019t think\n   there\u2019s a basis for that.\u201d\nInstead, the court gave general instructions relating to\npremises liability as well as an instruction on slip-and-fall:\n   \u201cA possessor of premises has a duty to make the premise\n   reasonably safe for an invitee\u2019s visit. The possessor must\n   exercise reasonable care to discover any condition that cre-\n   ates an unreasonable risk of harm to the invitee and either\n   eliminate the condition or warn any foreseeable invitee of\n   the risk so the invitee can avoid the harm. If the condition\n   cannot be encountered with reasonable safety, even if the\n   danger was known and appreciated by the invitee, the pos-\n   sessor is obligated to do more than warn. The possessor\n   must take reasonable and feasible steps to eliminate the\n   danger.\n   \u201cOregon law does not automatically impose liability against\n   a business for every slip and fall accident that occurs on the\n   premises. The role of the possessor is not that of an insurer\n   against accidents upon the premises, even as to persons who\n   they have invited to appear. Excuse me. Invited to enter.\n   The mere fact that an invitee was injured on the premises\n   does not, by itself, give rise to an inference of negligence.\n   \u201cIn premises liability cases like this one, where the Plaintiff\n   claims to have been injured by slipping on a sign on the\n   ground of the Defendant\u2019s store, liability will not attach\n   unless the Defendant had actual or constructive knowledge\n   of the sign on the ground and failed to use reasonable care\n   to remove it.\n   \u201cTo prove the Defendant had knowledge of the sign on the\n   ground the Plaintiff must prove one of three things: (1) the\n   sign was placed on the ground by the Defendant, or (2) the\n   Defendant knew that the sign was there and failed to use\n   reasonable diligence to remove it, or (3) the sign had been\n   on the ground for such a length of time that the Defendant\n   should, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, have discov-\n   ered it and removed it.\u201d\n\f116                            Fisk v. Fred Meyer Stores, Inc.\n\n         The jury returned a verdict for defendant. On\nappeal, plaintiff does not assign error to the instructions\nthat the trial court gave or to the trial court\u2019s characteri-\nzation of the claim as involving a slip and fall but argues\nthat the court erred in failing to give plaintiff\u2019s requested\nres ipsa loquitur instruction. \u201cAs a general rule, parties in\na civil action are entitled to jury instructions on their the-\nory of the case if their requested instructions correctly state\nthe law, are based on the current pleadings in the case, and\nare supported by evidence.\u201d Vandeveere-Pratt v. Portland\nHabilitation Center, 242 Or App 554, 557-58, 259 P3d 9\n(2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). Plaintiff con-\ntends that the evidence at trial supported the giving of the\nres ipsa loquitur instruction and that the trial court erred\nin reasoning that res ipsa loquitur was precluded by the fact\nthat the sign was located in a public area and therefore not\nwithin defendant\u2019s exclusive control.\n          Defendant responds, as argued below, that plain-\ntiff\u2019s claim is a \u201cslip and fall\u201d claim to which the doctrine\nof res ipsa loquitur does not apply. See German v. Kienow\u2019s\nFood Stores, 246 Or 334, 336, 425 P2d 523 (1967) (stating\nthat Oregon has not \u201cyet adopted the rule of res ipsa loqui-\ntur in \u2018slip and fall\u2019 cases, and it is still necessary to supply\nsome proof of fault\u201d). Defendant argues, further, that it was\nnot defendant\u2019s burden to show that the sign was not within\ndefendant\u2019s exclusive control but plaintiff\u2019s burden to show\nthat the sign and its frame were within defendant\u2019s exclusive\ncontrol, and that she has failed to do that. In her reply brief,\nplaintiff argues that res ipsa loquitur does not depend on the\n\u201cmechanism of injury,\u201d i.e., whether the injury occurred as a\nresult of a slip and fall, but on whether the evidence would\nallow a finding that the probability of the defendant\u2019s negli-\ngence is greater than the probability of other causes.\n        As the trial court correctly instructed, the general\nrule of premises liability is that possessors of land must\n\u201cmake their property reasonably safe for their invitees.\u201d\nHughes v. Wilson, 345 Or 491, 497, 199 P3d 305 (2008). That\nduty requires the possessor to exercise due care to discover\nconditions on the premises that create an unreasonable risk\nof harm to invitees or warn them of the risk so as to enable\n\fCite as 339 Or App 112 (2025)                                  117\n\nthem to avoid the harm. Woolston v. Wells, 297 Or 548, 557-\n58, 687 P2d 144 (1984).\n          Our caselaw and that of the Supreme Court make\nclear that slip-and-fall claims involving substances or objects\non the floor or ground are simply a subcategory of premises\nliability to which general premises liability standards apply.\nHagler v. Coastal Farm Holdings, Inc., 354 Or 132, 141, 309\nP3d 1073 (2013); Moorehead v. Tri-Met, 273 Or App 54, 359\nP3d 314 (2015), rev den, 358 Or 550 (2016) (\u201cWe conclude that\nthe distinction plaintiff seeks to draw between \u2018condition\u2019\ncases and \u2018foreign substance\u2019 cases is nonexistent.\u201d). When a\nclaim involves a substance or object on the floor or ground,\nthe liability of a business owner depends on evidence that\nthe owner knew or should have known about the fallen sub-\nstance or object. Hagler, 354 Or at 142. In the context of a\nslip-and-fall claim, proof of that liability is captured by the\nthree-factor test described in the caselaw:\n      \u201c(a) That the substance was placed there by the occu-\n   pant, or\n      \u201c(b) That the occupant knew that the substance was\n   there and failed to use reasonable diligence to remove it, or\n       \u201c(c) That the foreign substance had been there for such\n   a length of time that the occupant should, by the exercise of\n   reasonable diligence, have discovered and removed it.\u201d\nCowden v. Earley et al, 214 Or 384, 387, 327 P2d 1109 (1958).\n         Although reported slip-and-fall cases have most\ngenerally involved foreign substances on a floor that cause\na person to slip, Oregon courts have also applied slip-and-\nfall analysis to cases in which an invitee slips on or trips\nover an object in the aisle of a store. See, e.g., Lee v. Meier &\nFrank Co., 166 Or 600, 114 P2d 136 (1941) (holding that a\ncustomer who had tripped over a pillow in the aisle of a store\nfailed to state a claim against the owner of the store); see\nalso Hinchman v. UC Market, LLC, 270 Or App 561, 567 n 3,\n348 P3d 328 (2015) (observing that \u201cslip and fall\u201d analysis\napplied in a claim involving a negligently placed door mat).\n          We agree with defendant that because plain-\ntiff slipped on an object on the ground, plaintiff\u2019s claim is\ncorrectly characterized as a slip-and-fall claim. The trial\n\f118                                    Fisk v. Fred Meyer Stores, Inc.\n\ncourt\u2019s jury instructions therefore correctly described plain-\ntiff\u2019s burden. And, as the Supreme Court held in Kienow\u2019s\nFood Stores, 246 Or at 336, the trial court correctly held\nthat, because the claim involved a slip and fall, the doctrine\nof res ipsa loquitur did not apply.2\n         But even if plaintiff were correct that res ipsa loqui-\ntur could apply in the context of this slip-and-fall claim,\nwe would conclude that the trial court did not err in reject-\ning the requested res ipsa loquitur instruction here. That\nis because, in determining whether to give the requested\ninstruction, it was the trial court\u2019s role to determine whether\nthere was evidence from which the jury could find that the\naccident was of a kind more likely than not attributable to\ndefendant\u2019s negligence. Hammer v. Fred Meyer Stores, Inc.,\n242 Or App 185, 194, 255 P3d 598 (2011) (\u201c \u2018The determina-\ntion of where the probabilities lie must, ordinarily, be made\nupon the basis of past experience as it is seen and appraised\nby the court.\u201d\u2019 (quoting Kaufman, 230 Or at 639)). As the\ntrial court concluded, a jury could not plausibly have found\nthat it was more probable than not that defendant\u2019s failure\nto exercise reasonable care was the cause of the accident,\nbecause there were a number of causes other than defen-\ndant\u2019s alleged negligence that could have caused the sign to\nbe on the ground and plaintiff to fall. See Hammer, 242 Or\nApp at 190-91 (\u201cRes ipsa loquitur is a rule of circumstantial\nevidence that permits a jury to infer both negligence and\ncausation if the harm that occurs is \u2018\u201dof a kind that which\nmore probably than not would not have occurred in the\nabsence of negligence on the part of the defendant\u201d\u2019 McKee\nElectric Co. v. Carson Oil Co., 301 Or 339, 353, 723 P2d 288\n(1986) (quoting Watzig v. Tobin, 292 Or 645, 649, 642 P2d\n651 (1982)).\u201d). We conclude, therefore, that the trial court did\nnot err in declining to give plaintiff\u2019s requested instruction.\n         Plaintiff concedes that her second assignment of\nerror, in which she contends that the trial court erred in\n\n     2\n       We do not conclude here that res ipsa loquitur could never apply to a claim\nin which a business invitee slips and falls in the defendant\u2019s premises. But appli-\ncation of the presumption of res ipsa loquitur to a claim like plaintiff\u2019s, where,\nas here, a business invitee slips on a substance or object on the business own-\ner\u2019s floor or ground, is inconsistent with the three-factor inquiry that generally\napplies to the determination of liability in those types of cases.\n\fCite as 339 Or App 112 (2025)                             119\n\nadmitting testimony of plaintiff\u2019s treating physician, is con-\ntingent on our acceptance of plaintiff\u2019s first assignment of\nerror, and we therefore do not reach it.\n        Affirmed.\n\f",

The Starbucks is\nrun by defendant\u2019s employees. It is undisputed that defen-\ndant\u2019s employees did not place the sign on the ground and\ndid not know that it had fallen out of its frame. Plaintiff did\nnot assert that defendant had constructive knowledge that\nthe sign was on the ground.\n         Plaintiff conceded below that res ipsa loquitur does\nnot apply to typical slip-and-fall claims, which typically\ninvolve substances on a floor that might have been handled\n\f114                                     Fisk v.

The possessor\n   must take reasonable and feasible steps to eliminate the\n   danger.\n   \u201cOregon law does not automatically impose liability against\n   a business for every slip and fall accident that occurs on the\n   premises.

Our conclusion that DHS failed to prove that petitioner intentionally\nfailed to report her household composition resolves that allegation and obviates\nthe need to address the third assignment.\n\f172                      Garrett-Sims v. Dept. of Human Services\n\nmember of [her] household.\u201d (Boldface and uppercase omit-\nted). During the contested hearing to substantiate that alle-\ngation, the Department of Human Services (DHS) offered\nevidence that Levi provided petitioner\u2019s address for his\nemployment applications, car registration, financial records,\nas well as a note from petitioner\u2019s landlord. In that note,\npetitioner\u2019s landlord listed Levi as an occupant of the apart-\nment, but admitted that he was a \u201chands off\u201d landlord and\nthus was \u201cnot sure\u201d who was living in the apartment. He\nalso stated that he met the family through his ex-girlfriend\nbut, after that relationship ended in October 2018, he had\n\u201clost touch\u201d with petitioner and Levi.\n        Petitioner disputed that Levi resided with her full-\ntime. She testified that Levi lives elsewhere \u201cninety-five\npercent of the time\u201d and that he uses her address only for\nmailing purposes. Levi was not listed on the lease of the\napartment. And in his own application for SNAP benefits,\nLevi wrote that he lives at petitioner\u2019s residence only \u201cpart-\ntime\u201d and that he also lives in his car.\n         The ALJ concluded that petitioner committed an\nIPV because the \u201coverwhelming evidence in the record\ndemonstrate[d] that\u201d petitioner intentionally misrepre-\nsented her household income by not reporting that Levi lived\nwith her.2 On appeal, petitioner contends that neither sub-\nstantial evidence nor reason supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion.\n         We \u201cshall set aside or remand the order if [we] find[ ]\nthat the order is not supported by substantial evidence in\nthe record.

Notwithstanding\nthe fact that petitioner did not bear the burden of proof at the hearing, there was\nevidence in the record that the couple had lived separately due to domestic vio-\nlence, and petitioner testified that DHS told her to not list Levi on the application\nif she was experiencing domestic violence, out of concern for her safety.\n\fNonprecedential Memo Op: 339 Or App 170 (2025)                             173\n\n         We conclude that substantial evidence does not sup-\nport the finding that petitioner intentionally misrepresented\nher household composition. The ALJ relied exclusively on\nthe facts that Levi listed petitioner\u2019s address on various doc-\numents and that petitioner\u2019s landlord was aware that Levi\nwas at petitioner\u2019s apartment at some point during 2018 to\nconclude that there was \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d that peti-\ntioner misrepresented Levi\u2019s housing status. However, Levi\u2019s\nuse of the address is not on its own sufficient to prove by\nclear and convincing evidence that petitioner intentionally\nprovided false information on her applications, particularly\nwhen evidence in the record supports the contention that\nLevi lived in multiple places. The only other evidence sup-\nporting the ALJ\u2019s decision\u2014petitioner\u2019s landlord\u2019s note stat-\ning that Levi lived there\u2014also states that the landlord had\n\u201clost touch\u201d with petitioner and was unaware of who was\nin the apartment during most of the time period relevant\nto the hearing. Moreover, there was significant countervail-\ning evidence, including petitioner\u2019s testimony, the lease, and\nLevi\u2019s benefits applications.3 Accordingly, we conclude that\nthe ALJ\u2019s finding that DHS proved by clear and convinc-\ning evidence that petitioner intentionally misrepresented\nher household composition is not supported by substantial\nevidence. See Smithee v. Employment Dept., 228 Or App\n346, 350, 208 P3d 956 (2009) (concluding that substantial\nevidence did not support the ALJ\u2019s finding that claimant,\nwho undisputedly went over his break time, intentionally\nviolated a timekeeping regulation because there was coun-\ntervailing evidence that his employer allowed him to take\nunreported breaks and lacked a clear policy on work-break\nreporting).\n           Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n    3\n      Petitioner sought an extension of time, her first request, to obtain addi-\ntional evidence given that DHS had a year to prepare its case and her Oregon\nLaw Center attorney had less than three weeks to marshal evidence, and, addi-\ntionally, was scheduled to be out of the office during the hearing.

Property and Casualty Ins. Co. of Hartford\n\n            TOOKEY, P. J.\n         Plaintiffs Richard and Rita Griffith lost their home\nin a fire. They filed a claim with Hartford, their homeown-\ner\u2019s insurer. Hartford accepted the claim and made several\npayments and continued to adjust the claim. But plaintiffs\nbelieved that Hartford was not acting with sufficient alac-\nrity, and they retained attorney Vance. Vance filed a civil\naction against Hartford, alleging breach of contract, inten-\ntional infliction of emotional distress, and negligence, and\nseeking damages and prejudgment interest.\n         The complaint and Hartford\u2019s answer were the only\nfilings relating to Hartford in plaintiffs\u2019 civil action. Shortly\nthereafter, plaintiffs and Hartford executed a \u201cRelease and\nSettlement Agreement,\u201d under which the parties settled\nplaintiffs\u2019 insurance and breach of contract claims \u201cand\nall related controversies.\u201d Plaintiffs then filed a motion for\nsummary judgment in the proceeding, seeking prejudgment\ninterest from Hartford under ORS 82.010,1 on the theory\nthat the amount due on plaintiffs\u2019 insurance claim became\n\n     1\n       ORS 82.010 provides, in part:\n          \u201c(1) The rate of interest for the following transactions, if the parties have\n     not otherwise agreed to a rate of interest, is nine percent per annum and is\n     payable on:\n          \u201c(a) All moneys after they become due; but open accounts bear interest\n     from the date of the last item thereof.\n          \u201c(b) Money received to the use of another and retained beyond a reason-\n     able time without the owner\u2019s express or implied consent.\n          \u201c(c) Money due or to become due where there is a contract to pay interest\n     and no rate specified.\n          \u201c(2) Except as provided in this subsection, the rate of interest on judg-\n     ments for the payment of money is nine percent per annum. The following\n     apply as described:\n          \u201c(a) Interest on a judgment under this subsection accrues from the date\n     of the entry of the judgment unless the judgment specifies another date.\n          \u201c(b) Interest on a judgment under this subsection is simple interest,\n     unless otherwise provided by contract.\n          \u201c(c) Interest accruing from the date of the entry of a judgment shall also\n     accrue on interest that accrued before the date of entry of a judgment.\n          \u201c(d) Interest under this subsection shall also accrue on attorney fees and\n     costs entered as part of the judgment.\n          \u201c(e) A judgment on a contract bearing more than nine percent interest\n     shall bear interest at the same rate provided in the contract as of the date of\n     entry of the judgment.\u201d\n\fCite as 339 Or App 40 (2025)                                 43\n\nascertainable (and therefore \u201cdue\u201d) thirty days after the\nclaim was filed and that prejudgment interest was owed\nas provided in ORS 82.010(1), on \u201c[a]ll moneys after they\nbecome due.\u201d The trial court denied the motion, determin-\ning that it was premature, as there had been no judgment\nentered against Hartford.\n         Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their remaining\nclaims against Hartford. They then filed a petition for attor-\nney fees and costs and also refiled their motion for summary\njudgment seeking prejudgment interest. The trial court\nentered what was captioned a \u201csupplemental judgment,\u201d\ndenying plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on their\nrequest for prejudgment interest. In a limited judgment, the\ntrial court denied plaintiffs\u2019 request for costs but awarded\nplaintiffs their attorney fees of $221,179.27.\n         Plaintiffs appeal from the supplemental judgment,\nassigning error to the denial of their motion for summary\njudgment on their claim of prejudgment interest and appeal\nfrom a limited judgment denying costs. Hartford cross-\nappeals from the trial court\u2019s limited judgment awarding\nplaintiffs attorney fees, asserting that the trial court erro-\nneously awarded fees on a contingent or percentage-of-re-\ncovery basis. On plaintiffs\u2019 appeal of the supplemental judg-\nment denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment, we\nconclude that the supplemental judgment is not an appeal-\nable judgment and therefore dismiss the appeal; on plain-\ntiffs\u2019 appeal of the limited judgment, we conclude that the\ntrial court did not err or abuse its discretion in rejecting\nplaintiffs\u2019 request to recover their costs. On Hartford\u2019s cross-\nappeal of the limited judgment, we conclude that the trial\ncourt abused its discretion in determining that a fee based\non a contingency or a percentage of recovery\u2014rather than\nbased on hours worked\u2014was a reasonable fee, and, there-\nfore, reverse and remand for reconsideration of the limited\njudgment awarding fees.\n        In their first assignment of error, plaintiffs contend\nthat the trial court erred in denying their motion for sum-\nmary judgment on their claim for what they characterize\nas \u201cprejudgment interest.\u201d As noted, plaintiffs filed their\nmotion after they had reached a settlement with Hartford\n\f44   Griffith v. Property and Casualty Ins. Co. of Hartford\n\non their insurance claim and had fully released Hartford on\nthe breach of contract claims, which were the only claims\nthat could support an award of prejudgment interest, had a\njudgment been entered. But there was no general judgment\nand no limited monetary judgment for plaintiffs on either\nthe insurance claim or on plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract or\ntort claims. On the motion, the trial court entered a docu-\nment captioned \u201cSupplemental Judgment\u201d in which it stated\nthat the summary judgment was \u201cdenied.\u201d Plaintiffs con-\ntend that the trial court erred in denying their motion for\nsummary judgment, because the amount of interest owed to\nplaintiffs as of the date that Hartford should have paid pol-\nicy limits (which plaintiffs assert was within 30 days after\nplaintiffs\u2019 loss) was readily ascertainable, and prejudgment\ninterest was therefore awardable under ORS 82.010.\n         Hartford responds that the court\u2019s denial of the\nmotion is either not reviewable or was correct on its mer-\nits, because there is no basis for an award of prejudgment\ninterest in the absence of a judgment. Additionally, even\nassuming reviewability, Hartford asserts that the record as\nto plaintiffs\u2019 entitlement to prejudgment interest includes\ndisputed issues of material fact.\n        For several reasons, the trial court\u2019s ruling is not\nreviewable. First and foremost, the document captioned\n\u201cSupplemental Judgment,\u201d which simply denied plaintiffs\u2019\nmotion for summary judgment, is not an appealable judg-\nment. That is because it is not a proper supplemental judg-\nment, as no general judgment had been entered on plaintiffs\u2019\nbreach of contract claims. ORS 18.005(17) (A supplemental\njudgment is \u201ca judgment that may be rendered after a gen-\neral judgment pursuant to a legal authority.\u201d).\n         Secondly, even if the supplemental judgment were\nappealable, the denial of the motion for summary judg-\nment would not be reviewable. That is because, with limited\nexceptions, the denial of a motion for summary judgment\nis not reviewable on appeal. See Martin v. State of Oregon,\n331 Or App 225, 226 n 1, 545 P3d 776 (2024) (stating rule);\nFarnsworth v. Meadowland Ranches, Inc., 321 Or App 814,\n819, 519 P3d 153 (2022) (noting that \u201ca trial court\u2019s denial\nof summary judgment is generally unreviewable on appeal,\n\fCite as 339 Or App 40 (2025)                                               45\n\nwith limited exceptions,\u201d such as when the motion rests on\n\u201cpurely legal contentions\u201d). For example, in a case that has\ngone to trial, the denial of a summary judgment motion is\nsubject to review on appeal if the motion rested on a \u201cpurely\nlegal\u201d contention. Seidel v. Time Ins. Co., 157 Or App 556,\n560, 970 P2d 255 (1998). And when, for example, the appeal\narises from cross-motions for summary judgment, the grant-\ning of one motion and the denial of the other are both review-\nable. Eden Gate, Inc. v. D&L Excavating & Trucking, Inc.,\n178 Or App 610, 622, 37 P3d 233 (2002). This case does not\ninvolve either of those limited exceptions. Thus, we decline\nto address the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 challenge in their first\nassignment of error to the trial court\u2019s denial of their motion\nfor summary judgment seeking prejudgment interest.\n         In their second assignment of error, plaintiffs chal-\nlenge a limited judgment of the trial court declining to award\nthem costs on their claims against Hartford. Plaintiffs con-\ntend that, because attorney fees to which they are entitled\nunder ORS 742.061(1) are awarded \u201cas part of the costs of\nthe action,\u201d they are necessarily entitled to costs. We do not\nagree. ORCP 68 authorizes a court to award costs to a pre-\nvailing party. Having settled their contract claims against\nHartford and voluntarily dismissed their tort claims, we\nagree with Hartford that it was within the trial court\u2019s dis-\ncretion to determine whether plaintiffs prevailed in their\naction and were entitled to costs; the trial court did not\nabuse its discretion in determining that plaintiffs did not\nprevail in their action. See ORCP 54 A(3).2\n         We move on to Hartford\u2019s cross-appeal, in which\nHartford challenges the limited judgment awarding to\nplaintiffs attorney fees based on a percentage of plaintiffs\u2019\nrecovery rather than based on an hourly rate. What consti-\ntutes reasonable attorney fees is within the sound discre-\ntion of the court ordering the fee award. See ORS 20.075(3)\n(providing that \u201cthe decision of the court as to the amount\nof the award\u201d is reviewed for \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d). Hartford\n   2\n     ORCP 54 A(3)provides:\n       \u201cWhen an action is dismissed under this section, the judgment may\n   include any costs and disbursements, including attorney fees, provided by\n   contract, statute, or rule. Unless the circumstances indicate otherwise, the\n   dismissed party shall be considered the prevailing party.\u201d\n\f46      Griffith v. Property and Casualty Ins. Co. of Hartford\n\ndoes not dispute that plaintiffs were entitled to attorney fees\nunder ORS 742.061(1), which provides:\n     \u201c[I]f settlement is not made within six months from the\n     date proof of loss is filed with an insurer and an action is\n     brought in any court of this state upon any policy of insur-\n     ance of any kind or nature, and the plaintiff\u2019s recovery\n     exceeds the amount of any tender made by the defendant\n     in such action, a reasonable amount to be fixed by the court\n     as attorney fees shall be taxed as part of the costs of the\n     action and any appeal thereon.\u201d\n(Emphasis added.) Hartford acknowledges that plaintiffs\nwere entitled to attorney fees, because Hartford did not pay\nplaintiffs for the full loss within six months from the date\nof proof of loss. Hartford only disputes the basis on which\nthe trial court calculated the attorney fees and the amount\nawarded.\n         ORS 20.075 outlines a number of factors that the\ncourt must consider in setting a reasonable fee within its\ndiscretion, such as the time and labor required in the pro-\nceeding and the results obtained. Thoens v. Safeco Ins. Co.,\n317 Or App 727, 744, 507 P3d 284, adh\u2019d to as modified on\nrecons, 319 Or App 450, 508 P3d 1001 (2022) (\u201cA court has\nthe discretion to determine what amounts to a reasonable\nfee by considering the factors in ORS 20.075(1) and (2). ORS\n20.075(3) (providing that \u2018the decision of the court as to the\namount of the award\u2019 is reviewed for \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019)).\nHartford does not dispute that determining the amount\nof fees was within the trial court\u2019s discretion and that we\nreview that determination for an abuse of discretion. But\nHartford contends that, under the circumstances of this\ncase, the trial court abused its discretion in basing the fee\naward on a percentage of plaintiffs\u2019 recovery on their insur-\nance claim rather than on the \u201clodestar\u201d calculation\u2014a fee\nbased on an hourly rate. We agree with Hartford that, under\nthe circumstances here, the trial court abused its discretion\nin determining that a percentage of recovery was a reason-\nable basis on which calculate the amount of the attorney fee.\n        In any case in which an award of attorney fees is\nauthorized or required by statute, ORS 20.075(2) requires\nthe court to consider the factors in ORS 20.075(1) and\n\fCite as 339 Or App 40 (2025)                                      47\n\n20.075(2) in determining a reasonable amount of the fee. In\nFriends of Columbia Gorge v. Energy Fac. Siting Coun., 367\nOr 258, 267, 477 P3d 1191 (2020), the court stated,\n   \u201cThose factors are frequently captured by the \u2018lodestar\u2019\n   approach, under which a fee award is \u2018based on a reason-\n   able hourly rate, multiplied by a reasonable number of\n   hours devoted to work on the case, with certain adjust-\n   ments potentially made to that amount for factors such\n   as the risk of loss and the quality of the attorney\u2019s work.\u2019\n   Strawn[ v. Farmers Ins. Co., 353 Or 210, 217, 297 P3d 439\n   (2013)].\u201d\nIn contrast to the lodestar method, under which the fee is\ndetermined based on a reasonable hourly rate multiplied by\na reasonable number of hours devoted to work on the case,\nwith possible adjustments for factors such as the risk of loss\nand the quality of the attorney\u2019s work, the percent-of-recov-\nery method sets the fee by calculating the total recovery\nsecured by the attorney and awarding a reasonable per-\ncentage of that recovery. In general, the lodestar method\nis thought to more directly account for the amount of work\ndone; the percent-of-recovery method more directly reflects\nthe result achieved. Strawn, 353 Or at 219 (discussing the\ntwo approaches in the context of class-action claims involv-\ning fee-shifting statutes and common funds). The lodestar\nmethod is the prevailing method for determining the rea-\nsonableness of a fee award in cases, such as this, involv-\ning a statutory fee-shifting award, even when, as here, the\ninsured has retained counsel on a contingency-fee basis. Id.\nThe percentage-of-fund basis is a particularly appropriate\nmethod when there is a risk of recovery, when litigation has\nbeen extensive, or when the recovery involves a common\nfund from which attorney fees can be paid. See id. at 221.\n          Whichever method for the calculation of an award\nof fees is chosen, the amount awarded under ORS 742.061(1)\nmust be reasonable; a windfall award of attorney fees is to\nbe avoided. See ZRZ Realty v. Beneficial Fire and Casualty\nIns. Co., 255 Or App 524, 556-57, 300 P3d 1224 (2013) (The\n\u201cpotential for a windfall\u201d in an award of attorney fees \u201cis a\nfactor that the court can consider in setting a reasonable\nattorney fee.\u201d). Here, for the following reasons, we agree\nwith Hartford that the award the trial court made based on\n\f48    Griffith v. Property and Casualty Ins. Co. of Hartford\n\na percentage of plaintiffs\u2019 insurance recovery resulted in a\nwindfall that plaintiffs failed to establish was reasonable.\n          There was never a dispute or litigation as to\nHartford\u2019s liability for coverage of plaintiffs\u2019 insurance\nclaim; the claim was immediately accepted by Hartford, and\nwhen plaintiffs retained their attorney and filed this action,\nHartford had already made several payments and was con-\ntinuing to adjust the claim. And because, before plaintiffs\u2019\ncounsel was retained, the claim had not fully resolved within\nsix months of proof of loss, there was never doubt that an\nattorney retained by plaintiffs would be entitled to fees\nunder ORS 742.061(1), because Hartford had not made a\ntender of the full amount that it ultimately paid under the\npolicy. Because plaintiffs\u2019 counsel did not keep time records,\nthere is no evidence, other than filings, as to how much time\nhe spent on the case. Prior to the parties\u2019 settlement and\nrelease, there was minimal litigation by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\n(the filing of a complaint) with respect to plaintiffs\u2019 claims\nagainst Hartford. A delay in adjusting plaintiffs\u2019 claim was\ncaused by circumstances outside of the parties\u2019 control,\nincluding plaintiffs\u2019 remote location, winter weather, the dif-\nficulty locating a contractor to do cleanup, and the pandemic.\nBut there was never a risk that plaintiffs would not receive\nbenefits under the policy or that their attorney would not be\nentitled to a reasonable attorney fee under ORS 742.061(1).\nThe case was not complex. It did not involve a \u201ccommon fund,\u201d\nwhich might justify a fee based on the percentage of recov-\nery. See Strawn 353 Or at 217. And despite having agreed to\ndo so in his fee agreement with plaintiffs, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\ndid not keep or provide time records of the hours spent on the\nclaim against Hartford, against which the trial court could\nhave evaluated whether the lodestar method would be suffi-\ncient to reasonably compensate plaintiffs\u2019 counsel.\n         Plaintiffs, as the party seeking an award of fees,\nhad the burden of establishing the reasonableness of the fee\namount under either method. Hillsboro v. Maint. & Const.\nServ., 269 Or 169, 172, 523 P2d 1036 (1974) (where oppos-\ning party objects to attorney fee request, burden of proving\nreasonableness of fees rests on party seeking them). In light\nof the above-described circumstances, we conclude that the\n\fCite as 339 Or App 40 (2025)                               49\n\nrecord does not permit a conclusion that plaintiffs estab-\nlished the reasonableness of a fee award based on a percent-\nage of recovery, and that it was therefore an abuse of discre-\ntion by the trial court to determine that plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\nshould receive a fee under ORS 742.061(1) as a percentage of\nplaintiffs\u2019 recovery under the policy rather than under the\nlodestar method. We therefore reverse the award of attorney\nfees in the limited judgment and remand for reconsideration\nof the fee award.\n         On appeal of limited judgment, denial of costs\naffirmed; on appeal of supplemental judgment, appeal dis-\nmissed; on cross-appeal, limited judgment awarding attor-\nney fees reversed and remanded.\n\f",

United States, 582 US 357, 364-65, 137 S Ct\n1958, 198 L Ed 2d 476 (2017) (holding that, under the Sixth\n\fNonprecedential Memo Op: 339 Or App 158 (2025)           163\n\nAmendment to the United States Constitution, \u201cwhen a\ndefendant claims that his counsel\u2019s deficient performance\ndeprived him of a trial by causing him to accept a plea, the\ndefendant can show prejudice by demonstrating a reason-\nable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not\nhave pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to\ntrial\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n         That is, the evidence that trial counsel could have\nobtained was unlikely to have changed the outcome of a\ntrial. See Saroian v. State of Oregon, 154 Or App 112, 118,\n961 P2d 252 (1998) (\u201c[W]here the alleged error of counsel is\na failure to investigate or discover potentially exculpatory\nevidence, the determination whether the error \u2018prejudiced\u2019\nthe defendant by causing him to plead guilty rather than go\nto trial will depend on the likelihood that discovery of the\nevidence would have led counsel to change his recommenda-\ntion as to the plea. This assessment, in turn, will depend in\nlarge part on a prediction whether the evidence would have\nchanged the outcome of a trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks\nand emphases omitted.)). And the record supports the post-\nconviction court\u2019s implicit finding that the evidence that\npetitioner contends trial counsel should have discovered\nwith reasonable investigation would not have resulted in a\nbetter plea offer from the state.

And at that hearing, petitioner confirmed to\nthe trial court that she \u201cread the plea petition [or] had it\ntranslated into her native language,\u201d that she \u201cunder[stood]\nthe plea petition,\u201d that she had \u201can adequate opportunity\nto review the plea petition, * * * court processes, and [her]\ndecision to enter a guilty plea with [her] attorney,\u201d and that\nshe \u201cunderstood what it is [she] was doing by pleading guilty\nto two counts of assault in the second degree.\u201d She also con-\nfirmed that she did not \u201cneed more time to speak\u201d with her\nattorney before the court accepted her guilty pleas and that\nshe was \u201cin fact guilty of two counts of assault in the sec-\nond degree as domestic violence offenses.\u201d Based on those\nresponses, the trial court accepted petitioner\u2019s guilty plea.\n         Finally, petitioner did not produce evidence that she\nwas confused about any of the specific rights that she was\nwaiving by entering a plea or about the specific terms of\nthe plea itself. See Wilson v. Armenakis, 144 Or App 587,\n589, 928 P2d 354 (1996), rev den, 324 Or 560 (1997) (reject-\ning post-conviction petitioner\u2019s claim that his plea was not\nknowing and voluntary, where post-conviction court found\nthat the \u201cpetitioner executed a plea petition that set out the\nrights that he was waiving,\u201d that \u201ctrial counsel read the peti-\ntion to petitioner before he entered his guilty plea,\u201d and that,\n\u201cbefore accepting the plea, the trial court assured itself that\npetitioner\u2019s plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent\u201d).\n        Affirmed.\n\f",

We affirm.\n           We review the grant of an ORCP 21 motion to dis-\nmiss for legal error, Hernandez v. Catholic Health Initiatives,\n311 Or App 70, 72, 490 P3d 166 (2021), assuming \u201cthat all\nwell-pleaded facts are true and giv[ing] plaintiff the bene-\nfit of all favorable inferences that reasonably may be drawn\nfrom those factual allegations,\u201d Piazza v. Kellim, 360 Or 58,\n61, 377 P3d 492 (2016).1\n          Plaintiff entered Mt. Tabor Park, a city park owned\nby defendant, to recreate and \u201cwalk its trails.\u201d While walk-\ning on a paved road toward the exit of the park, plain-\ntiff stepped into a hole in the pavement and was severely\ninjured. Plaintiff sued defendant for negligence, and defen-\ndant moved to dismiss on the ground that, based on plain-\ntiff\u2019s complaint, the affirmative defense of recreational use\nimmunity applied and barred plaintiff\u2019s claim. See ORS\n105.682 (limiting liability of owner of land for certain inju-\nries that arise out of recreational use).2 The trial court\nagreed with defendant and dismissed plaintiff\u2019s complaint\nwith prejudice and denied her motion to replead, reasoning\n    1\n      The parties do not address, and we do not decide, whether ORCP 21 A is the\ncorrect procedural vehicle for the affirmative defense of recreational use immu-\nnity. Compare ORCP 21 A(1) (listing enumerated defenses available in motion to\ndismiss) with ORCP 19 B (listing defenses that a party \u201cshall\u201d plead, including\n\u201cany other matter constituting an * * * affirmative defense).\n    2\n      The recreational use immunity statute, ORS 105.682, in relevant part, pro-\nvides that:\n    \u201can owner of land is not liable in contract or tort for any personal injury,\n    death or property damage that arises out of the use of the land for recre-\n    ational purposes * * * when the owner of land either directly or indirectly\n    permits any person to use the land for recreational purposes * * *. The limita-\n    tion on liability provided by this section applies if the principal purpose for\n    entry upon the land is for recreational purposes * * * and is not affected if the\n    injury, death or damage occurs while the person entering land is engaging in\n    activities other than the use of the land for recreational purposes[.]\u201d\n\f102                                 Laxer v. City of Portland\n\nthat any amendment would be futile. On appeal, plaintiff\nasserts that the trial court erred in ruling that recreational\nuse immunity applied and in denying plaintiff the opportu-\nnity to replead her complaint.\n         First Assignment of Error. Plaintiff first assigns\nerror to the trial court\u2019s grant of defendant\u2019s motion to dis-\nmiss on the ground that recreational use immunity applied.\nOn appeal, plaintiff asserts three arguments: (1) defen-\ndant\u2019s affirmative actions in paving the roads and walk-\nways in Mt. Tabor and representing to the public that those\nroads and walkways were \u201caccessible\u201d constitute intentional\nconduct which renders recreational use immunity unavail-\nable to defendant, ORS 105.682(2) (\u201cThis section does not\nlimit the liability of an owner of land for intentional injury\nor damage.\u201d); (2) the elements of recreational use immunity\nwere not met, because plaintiff was not engaged in a recre-\national purpose at the time of her injury; and (3) the roads\nand paths of Mt. Tabor are like a public sidewalk\u2014which\nfall outside the scope of recreational immunity, because\nthey are used by the public for various purposes. See Landis\nv. Limbaugh, 282 Or App 284, 294, 385 P3d 1139 (2016),\nrev dismissed, 361 Or 351 (2017) (recreational use immunity\nunavailable to defendant for injury that occurred on regular\npedestrian sidewalk).\n         We do not address plaintiff\u2019s first argument, as it is\nunpreserved. See Summit RWP, Inc. v. Hallin, 334 Or App\n529, 535, 557 P3d 1113 (2024) (generally we will not consider\nargument based on new theory for the first time on appeal);\nJohn Hyland Const., Inc. v. Williamsen & Bleid, Inc., 287\nOr App 466, 471, 402 P3d 719 (2017) (\u201c[T]he purpose of an\nappeal is not to give the appellant an opportunity to pursue\na new theory that it did not rely on below.\u201d). And, assuming\nthat plaintiff\u2019s second argument is preserved, it is foreclosed\nby the text of the recreational use immunity statute and con-\ntrolling case law. Coleman v. Oregon Parks and Recreation\nDept., 347 Or 94, 102, 217 P3d 651 (2009) (noting that rec-\nreational use immunity extends \u201cas long as the injured per-\nson\u2019s principal purpose for entry is recreational, even if the\nperson was engaged in other nonrecreational activity at the\ntime of injury\u201d (citing ORS 105.682(1))).\n\fCite as 339 Or App 100 (2025)                                 103\n\nPlaintiff\u2019s last argument, as we understand it, is that (1) the\npaved walkways in Mt. Tabor are like the paved sidewalks\nto which recreational immunity did not apply in Landis and\n(2) the application of recreational immunity to some inju-\nries and not others would produce irrational results that we\nsought to avoid in Landis. 282 Or App at 295.\nPlaintiff extends Landis too far: although we held there that\ncertain kinds of generally available public land, like side-\nwalks, would be outside the scope of recreational use immu-\nnity, we expressly noted that some generally available land\nconnected with recreation would still be subject to immunity:\n   \u201cNowhere in legislative history do we find any suggestion\n   that recreational immunity would apply to streets or side-\n   walks that are already generally available to the public,\n   that are not attendant to parks or places of recreation, and\n   that the landowner has done nothing to \u2018make available\u2019 for\n   the statutorily specified recreational or similar uses.\u201d\nId. at 294 (emphasis added); see also Waggoner v. City of\nWoodburn, 196 Or App 715, 717, 103 P3d 648 (2004) (recre-\national use immunity applies to public city parks).\n          Lastly, we address a new, unbriefed argument,\nbrought up by plaintiff at oral argument for the first time,\nthat the location where plaintiff was injured\u2014a paved\naccess road within Mt. Tabor Park\u2014makes recreational use\nimmunity inapplicable to defendant. See ORS 105.688(1)(c)\n(2021), amended by Or Laws 2024, ch 64 \u00a7 7 (recreational\nuse immunity applies to \u201c[a]ll paths, trails, roads, * * * and\nother rights of way\u201d used to access land to recreate \u201cthat\nhave not been improved, designed or maintained for the spe-\ncific purpose of providing access for recreational purposes\u201d).\nThat new argument relies on Fields v. City of Newport, 326\nOr App 764, 533 P3d 384, rev den, 371 Or 476 (2023), in\nwhich we concluded that recreational use immunity would\nnot apply to a paved beach access trail used solely for access\nto the beach. Id. at 775. Although we are under no obligation\nto address that argument, we observe that it is foreclosed by\nour recent decision in Murphy v. City of Cannon Beach, 338\nOr App 104, 106-08, 108 n 2, ___ P3d ___ (2025) (holding\nthat ORS 105.688(1)(c) (2021) \u201cis relevant only where a plain-\ntiff is injured on land adjacent to the land that the person\n\f104                                Laxer v. City of Portland\n\nintends to use for recreational purposes\u201d (emphasis added)),\nand we decline to address it further, see ORAP 6.15(6) (\u201cIt\nis the general policy of Oregon appellate courts to prohibit\nreference at oral argument to any authority not cited either\nin a brief or in a pre-argument memorandum of additional\nauthorities.\u201d).\n          Second Assignment of Error. Plaintiff next contends\nthat the trial court erred by denying leave to amend her\ncomplaint. Plaintiff requested leave to amend \u201cin order to\nmore fully allege her purpose for being on the walkway in\nMt. Tabor, and to more fully articulate her position that the\nCity\u2019s affirmative acts and conduct were such that [plain-\ntiff] relied on the City\u2019s representations to her detriment.\u201d\n         We review a court\u2019s denial of leave to amend after\nan ORCP 21 A dismissal for an abuse of discretion. Caldeen\nConstruction v. Kemp, 248 Or App 82, 86, 273 P3d 174 (2012).\nA trial court\u2019s discretion to grant or deny motions to amend\na complaint after a motion to dismiss is not limitless; it is\nbounded by the requirement that motions to amend should\nbe liberally granted if amendment would preclude the entry\nof a judgment. Id.

Tabor Park, a city park owned\nby defendant, to recreate and \u201cwalk its trails.\u201d While walk-\ning on a paved road toward the exit of the park, plain-\ntiff stepped into a hole in the pavement and was severely\ninjured. Plaintiff sued defendant for negligence, and defen-\ndant moved to dismiss on the ground that, based on plain-\ntiff\u2019s complaint, the affirmative defense of recreational use\nimmunity applied and barred plaintiff\u2019s claim. See ORS\n105.682 (limiting liability of owner of land for certain inju-\nries that arise out of recreational use).2 The trial court\nagreed with defendant and dismissed plaintiff\u2019s complaint\nwith prejudice and denied her motion to replead, reasoning\n    1\n      The parties do not address, and we do not decide, whether ORCP 21 A is the\ncorrect procedural vehicle for the affirmative defense of recreational use immu-\nnity. Compare ORCP 21 A(1) (listing enumerated defenses available in motion to\ndismiss) with ORCP 19 B (listing defenses that a party \u201cshall\u201d plead, including\n\u201cany other matter constituting an * * * affirmative defense).\n    2\n      The recreational use immunity statute, ORS 105.682, in relevant part, pro-\nvides that:\n    \u201can owner of land is not liable in contract or tort for any personal injury,\n    death or property damage that arises out of the use of the land for recre-\n    ational purposes * * * when the owner of land either directly or indirectly\n    permits any person to use the land for recreational purposes * * *. The limita-\n    tion on liability provided by this section applies if the principal purpose for\n    entry upon the land is for recreational purposes * * * and is not affected if the\n    injury, death or damage occurs while the person entering land is engaging in\n    activities other than the use of the land for recreational purposes[.]\u201d\n\f102                                 Laxer v. City of Portland\n\nthat any amendment would be futile. On appeal, plaintiff\nasserts that the trial court erred in ruling that recreational\nuse immunity applied and in denying plaintiff the opportu-\nnity to replead her complaint.\n         First Assignment of Error. Plaintiff first assigns\nerror to the trial court\u2019s grant of defendant\u2019s motion to dis-\nmiss on the ground that recreational use immunity applied.\nOn appeal, plaintiff asserts three arguments: (1) defen-\ndant\u2019s affirmative actions in paving the roads and walk-\nways in Mt. Tabor and representing to the public that those\nroads and walkways were \u201caccessible\u201d constitute intentional\nconduct which renders recreational use immunity unavail-\nable to defendant, ORS 105.682(2) (\u201cThis section does not\nlimit the liability of an owner of land for intentional injury\nor damage.\u201d); (2) the elements of recreational use immunity\nwere not met, because plaintiff was not engaged in a recre-\national purpose at the time of her injury; and (3) the roads\nand paths of Mt. Tabor are like a public sidewalk\u2014which\nfall outside the scope of recreational immunity, because\nthey are used by the public for various purposes. See Landis\nv.

J.\n         Petitioner appeals a judgment denying his petition\nfor post-conviction relief from convictions for aggravated\nmurder with a firearm, attempted aggravated murder with\na firearm, first-degree assault with a firearm, second-degree\nassault with a firearm, and one count of unlawful use of a\nweapon. Petitioner was represented by a team of two attor-\nneys at trial. He alleges that his criminal trial counsel were\nconstitutionally inadequate and ineffective in a variety of\nrespects, and that the post-conviction court erred in deny-\ning relief on the alleged grounds of inadequacy and inef-\nfectiveness. We review the post-conviction court\u2019s denial of\npost-conviction relief for legal error, accepting the court\u2019s\nsupported implicit and explicit factual findings. Green v.\nFranke, 357 Or 301, 312, 350 P3d 188 (2015). Reviewing\nunder those standards, we affirm.\n          Legal Standards. At issue in this matter are par-\nallel claims of inadequate assistance of trial counsel under\nArticle I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution, and ineffec-\ntive assistance of trial counsel under the Sixth Amendment\nto the United States Constitution. To establish that his trial\ncounsel rendered inadequate assistance for purposes of\nArticle I, section 11, petitioner was required to prove two ele-\nments: (1) a performance element\u2014that trial counsel \u201cfailed\nto exercise reasonable professional skill and judgment\u201d; and\n(2) a prejudice element\u2014that \u201cpetitioner suffered prejudice\nas a result of counsel\u2019s inadequacy.\u201d Johnson v. Premo, 361\nOr 688, 699, 399 P3d 431 (2017). A functionally equivalent\ntwo-element standard governs petitioner\u2019s claim of ineffec-\ntive assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment. Id.\nTo prevail on that claim, petitioner was required to demon-\nstrate that \u201ctrial counsel\u2019s performance \u2018fell below an objec-\ntive standard of reasonableness\u2019 \u201d and also that \u201cthere was a\n\u2018reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional\nerrors, the result of the proceeding would have been differ-\nent.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 700 (quoting Strickland v. Washington, 466 US\n668, 694, 104 S Ct 2052, 80 L Ed 2d 674 (1984)).\n        Failure to File Motion to Suppress. In his first\nassignment of error, which is the only assignment of error\nasserted in the brief filed by counsel, petitioner contends\n\fNonprecedential Memo Op: 339 Or App 151 (2025)           153\n\nthat the post-conviction court erred by denying relief on his\nclaim that his trial counsel were inadequate and ineffective\nfor not moving to suppress statements that he made in a\npost-arrest interview. In denying relief, the post-conviction\ncourt credited petitioner\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s explanation as to\nwhy they did not move to suppress\u2014that parts of the inter-\nview would support petitioner\u2019s trial strategy of claiming\nself-defense, and that they did not have a basis to move\nto suppress the statements that petitioner made before he\nclearly invoked his Miranda rights. On this record, as the\npost-conviction court correctly concluded, neither of those\nassessments represents a failure to exercise reasonable pro-\nfessional skill and judgment.\n          It was not unreasonable for petitioner\u2019s trial coun-\nsel to think that the statements could buttress petition-\ner\u2019s self-defense strategy. Trial counsel reasoned that one\nof petitioner\u2019s statements in the interview\u2014\u201dthey go on\nme\u201d\u2014was consistent with his claim of self-defense and was\nimportant because of its timing. Because petitioner made it\nto the police soon after the shooting, it could demonstrate\nthat petitioner had not changed his story after the fact.\n          It also was not unreasonable for petitioner\u2019s trial\ncounsel to think that a motion to suppress would not have\nsucceeded. Although petitioner contends that reasonable\ncounsel would have argued that petitioner\u2019s statement that\n\u201cI don\u2019t know nothin\u2019 about nothin\u2019 \u201d was an invocation of his\nMiranda right to remain silent, on its face, the statement is\na disclaimer of knowledge that does not state or imply that\npetitioner did not want to talk to police. It therefore stands\nin stark contrast with the statements that the Supreme\nCourt and we have deemed to be unequivocal or equivocal\ninvocations of the Miranda right to remain silent, which\ncontain some reference to speaking. See State v. Nichols,\n361 Or 101, 104, 107, 390 P3d 1001 (2017) (concluding that\n\u201cit\u2019s not something I want to talk about\u201d was an unequivo-\ncal invocation of the right to remain silent); State v. Rose,\n296 Or App 99, 102, 108, 437 P3d 1144 (2019) (concluding\nthat \u201cI don\u2019t have nothing to say\u201d was an equivocal invo-\ncation). Given that contrast, petitioners\u2019 trial counsel rea-\nsonably could conclude that petitioner\u2019s statement, \u201cI don\u2019t\n\f154                                      Richardson v. Cain\n\nknow nothin\u2019 about nothin\u2019,\u201d would not support a motion to\nsuppress premised on the theory that the statement invoked\npetitioner\u2019s Miranda rights and reasonably decline to pur-\nsue such a motion.\n         Failure to Seek Exclusion of Evidence That the Gun\nWas Stolen. In his first pro se supplemental assignment,\npetitioner contends that trial counsel were inadequate and\nineffective for not moving in limine to exclude evidence that\nthe gun that petitioner used to shoot the victims was stolen.\nThe post-conviction court denied relief on this claim for a\nrange of reasons, including that petitioner did not demon-\nstrate that the inclusion of the evidence prejudiced him:\n\u201cPetitioner did not prove that the introduction of evidence\nthat [p]etitioner had stolen the gun used in the shooting\ncould have had a tendency to affect the outcome of the trial.\u201d\nOn review of the record, we agree with that conclusion.\nGiven the evidence of petitioner\u2019s conduct, and the minimal\nemphasis placed on how petitioner acquired the gun, it is\nunlikely that the evidence had any tendency to affect the\njury\u2019s decision.\n         Failure to Call Memory Expert. In his second pro\nse supplemental assignment, petitioner contends that his\ntrial counsel were inadequate and ineffective for not calling\na memory expert as a witness at trial to explain petition-\ner\u2019s trial testimony that he did not remember pulling out\nhis gun, pulling the trigger, or shooting anyone. The post-\nconviction court denied relief on this claim based on its fac-\ntual findings that petitioner had not told his attorneys that\nhe did not remember his conduct, and, on multiple occasions,\ngave detailed descriptions of the events leading to the shoot-\nings. This led the post-conviction court to the conclusion\nthat trial counsel had no reason to foresee the need for a\nmemory expert. Those findings are supported by the record\nand preclude the conclusion that counsel\u2019s omission to call a\nmemory expert represents a failure to exercise reasonable\nprofessional skill and judgment. Green, 357 Or at 312 (sup-\nported findings of fact binding on appellate court). Absent\nevidence that petitioner had memory issues as counsel pre-\npared for trial, there was no reason for counsel to consult a\nmemory expert.\n\fNonprecedential Memo Op: 339 Or App 151 (2025)             155\n\n         Failure to Call Self-Defense Expert. In his third pro\nse supplemental assignment, petitioner assigns error to the\npost-conviction court\u2019s denial of relief on his claim that coun-\nsel were inadequate and ineffective for not calling as a wit-\nness Bedard, an expert they had hired to support petition-\ner\u2019s claim of self-defense. Counsel hired Bedard to observe\npetitioner\u2019s testimony at trial and then provide expert tes-\ntimony as to how it was consistent with self-defense. After\npetitioner testified at trial that he did not remember pulling\nthe trigger or shooting people, the trial court imposed sig-\nnificant limitations on Bedard\u2019s potential testimony, includ-\ning prohibiting him from opining on self-defense or on peti-\ntioner\u2019s response to the situation he was in. It was under\nthose circumstances that counsel decided not to call Bedard\nand so trial counsels\u2019 decision was a reasonable one because,\ngiven the trial court\u2019s limitations, the testimony would have\ndone little, if anything, to advance the defense.\n        Petitioner also contends that trial counsel failed to\nproperly prepare Bedard for trial. But as the superintendent\npoints out, that particular claim is not preserved. Beyond\nthat, we note that it is not clear what counsel could have\ndone to prepare Bedard for trial, given the substantial and\nunanticipated change in petitioner\u2019s story once he took the\nstand.\n         Failure to Adequately Advise Petitioner. In his\nfourth pro se supplemental assignment, petitioner assigns\nerror the post-conviction court\u2019s denial of relief on his claim\nthat trial counsel were inadequate and ineffective in advis-\ning him regarding the possibility of the death penalty and\npotential issues of appeal. Petitioner asserts that counsels\u2019\ninadequate advice prejudiced him by causing him to waive\nhis right to appeal and stipulate to a sentence of life without\nparole, when he otherwise would not have agreed to stipu-\nlate.

In his first\nassignment of error, which is the only assignment of error\nasserted in the brief filed by counsel, petitioner contends\n\fNonprecedential Memo Op: </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">339 Or App 151</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2025)           153\n\nthat the post-conviction court erred by denying relief on his\nclaim that his trial counsel were inadequate and ineffective\nfor not moving to suppress statements that he made in a\npost-arrest interview. In denying relief, the post-conviction\ncourt credited petitioner\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s explanation as to\nwhy they did not move to suppress\u2014that parts of the inter-\nview would support petitioner\u2019s trial strategy of claiming\nself-defense, and that they did not have a basis to move\nto suppress the statements that petitioner made before he\nclearly invoked his Miranda rights. On this record, as the\npost-conviction court correctly concluded, neither of those\nassessments represents a failure to exercise reasonable pro-\nfessional skill and judgment.\n          It was not unreasonable for petitioner\u2019s trial coun-\nsel to think that the statements could buttress petition-\ner\u2019s self-defense strategy. Trial counsel reasoned that one\nof petitioner\u2019s statements in the interview\u2014\u201dthey go on\nme\u201d\u2014was consistent with his claim of self-defense and was\nimportant because of its timing. Because petitioner made it\nto the police soon after the shooting, it could demonstrate\nthat petitioner had not changed his story after the fact.\n          It also was not unreasonable for petitioner\u2019s trial\ncounsel to think that a motion to suppress would not have\nsucceeded. Although petitioner contends that reasonable\ncounsel would have argued that petitioner\u2019s statement that\n\u201cI don\u2019t know nothin\u2019 about nothin\u2019 \u201d was an invocation of his\nMiranda right to remain silent, on its face, the statement is\na disclaimer of knowledge that does not state or imply that\npetitioner did not want to talk to police. It therefore stands\nin stark contrast with the statements that the Supreme\nCourt and we have deemed to be unequivocal or equivocal\ninvocations of the Miranda right to remain silent, which\ncontain some reference to speaking.

Given that contrast, petitioners\u2019 trial counsel rea-\nsonably could conclude that petitioner\u2019s statement, \u201cI don\u2019t\n\f154                                      Richardson v. Cain\n\nknow nothin\u2019 about nothin\u2019,\u201d would not support a motion to\nsuppress premised on the theory that the statement invoked\npetitioner\u2019s Miranda rights and reasonably decline to pur-\nsue such a motion.\n         Failure to Seek Exclusion of Evidence That the Gun\nWas Stolen. In his first pro se supplemental assignment,\npetitioner contends that trial counsel were inadequate and\nineffective for not moving in limine to exclude evidence that\nthe gun that petitioner used to shoot the victims was stolen.\nThe post-conviction court denied relief on this claim for a\nrange of reasons, including that petitioner did not demon-\nstrate that the inclusion of the evidence prejudiced him:\n\u201cPetitioner did not prove that the introduction of evidence\nthat [p]etitioner had stolen the gun used in the shooting\ncould have had a tendency to affect the outcome of the trial.\u201d\nOn review of the record, we agree with that conclusion.\nGiven the evidence of petitioner\u2019s conduct, and the minimal\nemphasis placed on how petitioner acquired the gun, it is\nunlikely that the evidence had any tendency to affect the\njury\u2019s decision.\n         Failure to Call Memory Expert. In his second pro\nse supplemental assignment, petitioner contends that his\ntrial counsel were inadequate and ineffective for not calling\na memory expert as a witness at trial to explain petition-\ner\u2019s trial testimony that he did not remember pulling out\nhis gun, pulling the trigger, or shooting anyone. The post-\nconviction court denied relief on this claim based on its fac-\ntual findings that petitioner had not told his attorneys that\nhe did not remember his conduct, and, on multiple occasions,\ngave detailed descriptions of the events leading to the shoot-\nings. This led the post-conviction court to the conclusion\nthat trial counsel had no reason to foresee the need for a\nmemory expert. Those findings are supported by the record\nand preclude the conclusion that counsel\u2019s omission to call a\nmemory expert represents a failure to exercise reasonable\nprofessional skill and judgment.

In his third pro\nse supplemental assignment, petitioner assigns error to the\npost-conviction court\u2019s denial of relief on his claim that coun-\nsel were inadequate and ineffective for not calling as a wit-\nness Bedard, an expert they had hired to support petition-\ner\u2019s claim of self-defense. Counsel hired Bedard to observe\npetitioner\u2019s testimony at trial and then provide expert tes-\ntimony as to how it was consistent with self-defense. After\npetitioner testified at trial that he did not remember pulling\nthe trigger or shooting people, the trial court imposed sig-\nnificant limitations on Bedard\u2019s potential testimony, includ-\ning prohibiting him from opining on self-defense or on peti-\ntioner\u2019s response to the situation he was in. It was under\nthose circumstances that counsel decided not to call Bedard\nand so trial counsels\u2019 decision was a reasonable one because,\ngiven the trial court\u2019s limitations, the testimony would have\ndone little, if anything, to advance the defense.\n        Petitioner also contends that trial counsel failed to\nproperly prepare Bedard for trial. But as the superintendent\npoints out, that particular claim is not preserved. Beyond\nthat, we note that it is not clear what counsel could have\ndone to prepare Bedard for trial, given the substantial and\nunanticipated change in petitioner\u2019s story once he took the\nstand.\n         Failure to Adequately Advise Petitioner. In his\nfourth pro se supplemental assignment, petitioner assigns\nerror the post-conviction court\u2019s denial of relief on his claim\nthat trial counsel were inadequate and ineffective in advis-\ning him regarding the possibility of the death penalty and\npotential issues of appeal. Petitioner asserts that counsels\u2019\ninadequate advice prejudiced him by causing him to waive\nhis right to appeal and stipulate to a sentence of life without\nparole, when he otherwise would not have agreed to stipu-\nlate. The post-conviction court denied relief on this claim,\nexplaining its reasoning in detail, and finding that peti-\ntioner was advised extensively on the \u201cpluses and minuses\nof the resolution and the effect of waiving appeal.\u201d The post-\nconviction court further found that \u201cThere were no sure-fire\nissues on appeal and [p]etitioner was advised of his chances\non appeal.\u201d\n\f156                                       Richardson v. Cain\n\n         In challenging that ruling on appeal, petitioner\ndoes not dispute the post-conviction court\u2019s factual find-\nings, meaningfully engage with its reasoning, or point to\nany evidence in the record that would compel the court to\nconclude that petitioner met the burden of demonstrating\nthat the advice he received was mistaken or unreasonable.\nHowever, petitioner identifies three issues that he claims\n\u201ccould have been raised on direct appeal\u201d: a Batson issue; a\nmistrial issue; and an issue regarding the limitations that\nthe trial court placed on Bedard\u2019s potential testimony.

J.\n         Youth appeals a juvenile court order requiring him\nto report as a sex offender. He assigns error to the order\nitself and argues that the court applied an erroneous legal\nstandard in assessing whether he met his burden to prove\n\u201cby clear and convincing evidence that [he] is rehabilitated\nand does not pose a threat to the safety of the public,\u201d ORS\n163A.030(7)(b), because the court did not focus on youth\u2019s\ncurrent risk of sexual recidivism. Additionally, youth assigns\nerror to the court\u2019s exclusion of (1) an article about juvenile\nsexual recidivism (the Caldwell article1), (2) an article about\nthe effectiveness of specialized treatment programs for\njuvenile sex offenders (the Kettrey article2), and (3) youth\u2019s\noriginal treatment notebook. Youth argues that his expert\nrelied upon the research articles in her direct and rebuttal\ntestimony and that they were, thus, relevant to her credibil-\nity and conclusions. He argues that the original notebook\nwas relevant because it would allow him to rebut allegations\nthat he had forged certain initials in the notebook and that\nhe provided incomplete copies of the notebook to his benefit.\nAccording to youth, exclusion of the relevant exhibits was\nreversible error.\n         The state does not dispute that the excluded exhib-\nits are relevant. It argues instead that the exhibits were\nproperly excluded as a discretionary sanction for discovery\nviolations. Youth argues that the juvenile court abused its\ndiscretion when it excluded the exhibits because, under ORS\n163A.030(9), the statutory hearing is designed to allow the\njuvenile court to \u201creceive testimony, reports and other evi-\ndence, without regard to whether the evidence is admissible\nunder\u201d the rules of evidence if it is \u201crelated to the determi-\nnation and findings required under\u201d ORS 163A.030.\n        We conclude, for the reasons that follow, that the\nCaldwell and Kettrey articles, and the original treatment\nnotebook, were relevant to the issues before the juvenile\n\n   1\n      Michael F.

With respect to the merits of the court\u2019s decision\nordering youth to report as a sex offender, we conclude that\nthe record did not require it to answer the factual ques-\ntion under ORS 163A.030 in a different way. We, therefore,\naffirm.\n         Youth asks us to conduct de novo review. ORS\n19.415(3)(b) permits us, in our \u201csole discretion,\u201d to \u201ctry the\ncause anew upon the record or [to] make one or more factual\nfindings anew upon the record.\u201d ORAP 5.40(8) describes the\nprocess by which de novo review may be requested, and it\nprovides a nonexclusive and nonbinding list of items that\nwe consider relevant to the decision whether to exercise our\ndiscretion to conduct de novo review, emphasizing that we\nexercise our discretion to conduct de novo review only in\n\u201cexceptional cases.\u201d\n         We recently exercised our discretion to review the\nrecord de novo in two appeals of orders requiring sex offender\nreporting: State v. X. E. W., 331 Or App 1, 2, 546 P3d 288\n(2024) (exercising authority to review the record de novo \u201cin\norder to apply the legal principles outlined in State v. A. R.\nH., 371 Or 82, 530 P3d 897 (2023), which the Supreme Court\nissued after the parties submitted their briefs in this case\u201d)\nand State v. K. L. F., 333 Or App 434, 435, 552 P3d 722\n(2024) (exercising authority to review the record de novo, \u201c[a]\ns we recently did\u201d in X. E. W. because \u201cthe juvenile court\napplied an incorrect standard when assessing youth\u2019s risk\nof recidivism\u201d). This case is similar to both X. E. W. and K.\nL. F. in that the juvenile court ruled on youth\u2019s petition for\nrelief from sex offender requirements before A. R. H. was\npublished. However, this case does not present the same\nconcerns that were present in X. E. W. and K. L. F. about\nthe trial court\u2019s application of the correct legal framework.\nConsequently, we do not exercise our discretion to review\nthis case de novo.\n        We conduct our review of the juvenile court\u2019s order\nrequiring youth to report as a sex offender in accordance\nwith the usual standard of appellate review, recogniz-\ning that the juvenile court\u2019s assigned inquiry under ORS\n\fCite as 339 Or App 134 (2025)                                              137\n\n163A.030(7)(b) is \u201ca factual inquiry.\u201d A. R.

We\nreview the juvenile court\u2019s exclusion of relevant evidence as\nduplicative for abuse of discretion. See State v. Titus, 328 Or\n475, 481, 982 P2d 1133 (1999) (\u201cA decision to exclude evi-\ndence under OEC 403 is reserved to the trial court\u2019s discre-\ntion.\u201d). We conduct our review of the juvenile court\u2019s eviden-\ntiary rulings \u201cin light of the record that was before the court\nat the time of its ruling.\u201d State v. Rodriguez-Delao, 335 Or\nApp 700, 701, 560 P3d 85 (2024).\n         We turn to the pertinent underlying historical\nand procedural facts. The state filed a delinquency petition\nagainst youth, then 16 years of age, alleging that when he\nwas between the ages of 13 and 15, he had engaged in con-\nduct with two younger cousins and a half-sister that, if done\nby an adult, would constitute eight felony sex crimes. The\njuvenile court accepted \u201cAlford pleas\u201d from youth on Counts\n1 and 6, and an admission on Count 7.3 It then determined\n     3\n       Counts 1, 6, and 7 of the amended delinquency petition charged youth as\nfollows:\n     \u201cCount 1 Rape in the First Degree (ORS 163.375) (Class A Felony) The said\n     youth, on, about, or between June 30th, 2015 to June 30th, 2017, in Yamhill\n     County, Oregon, did unlawfully and knowingly engage in sexual intercourse\n     with B.H.P., a child under twelve years of age, said act of youth being con-\n     trary to the statutes in such cases made and provided and against the peace\n     and dignity of the State of Oregon.\n     \u201c* * * * *\n     \u201cCount 6 Attempted Sexual Abuse in the First Degree (ORS 161.405) (ORS\n     163.427) (Class C Felony) The said youth, on, about, or between June 30th,\n\f138                                                          State v. B. J. P.\n\nthat youth was within the delinquency jurisdiction of the\njuvenile court.4\n         An Alford plea is a reference to North Carolina v.\nAlford, 400 US 25, 91 S Ct 160, 27 L Ed 2d 162 (1970). It\nis equivalent to a \u201cno contest\u201d plea under ORS 135.335(1)\n(c). Commentary to Criminal Law Revision Commission\nProposed Oregon Criminal Procedure Code, Final Draft\nand Report \u00a7 252, 149 (Nov 1972). As we recently explained:\n    \u201c \u2018An Alford plea is a guilty plea in which the defendant does\n    not admit commission of the criminal act or asserts that he\n    is innocent.\u2019 State v. Sullivan, 197 Or App 26, 28 n 1, 104\n    P3d 636 (2005), rev den, 340 Or 673 (2006) (concluding that\n    it was not plain error for a trial court to rely on an Alford\n    plea as an admission of facts justifying a sentence enhance-\n    ment). With an Alford plea, a defendant does not admit\n    guilt \u2018but admits that sufficient evidence exists to convict\n    him of the offense.\u2019 United States v. Ramirez-Gonzalez, 755\n    F3d 1267, 1273 (11th Cir 2014).\n        \u201cBefore entering a judgment of conviction from a plea\n    of guilty or no contest, the trial court must \u2018mak[e] such\n    inquiry as may satisfy the court that there is a factual basis\n    for the plea.\u2019 ORS 135.395. The \u2018\u201dfactual basis for the plea\u201d\n    refers to facts concerning the defendant\u2019s guilt\u2014i.e., facts\n    regarding whether the defendant committed the crime to\n    which the defendant is pleading.\u2019 State v. Heisser, 232 Or\n    App 320, 329, 222 P3d 719 (2009).\u201d\nState v. Jackson, 319 Or App 789, 791, 511 P3d 82 (2022). In\nproceeding with Alford pleas, youth chose not to contest that\n    2015 to June 30th, 2017, in Yamhill County, Oregon, did unlawfully and\n    intentionally attempt by forcible compulsion to subject T.T., a child under\n    fourteen years of age, to sexual contact, to wit: causing T.T. to touch said\n    youth\u2019s penis, a sexual or intimate part of said youth, said act of youth being\n    contrary to the statutes in such cases made and provided and against the\n    peace and dignity of the State of Oregon.\n        \u201cCount 7 Attempted Sexual Abuse in the First Degree (ORS 161.405)\n        (ORS 163.427) (Class C Felony) The said youth, on, about, or between\n        October 31st, 2015 to October 31st, 2017, in Yamhill County, Oregon,\n        did unlawfully and intentionally attempt to subject G.C., a child under\n        fourteen years of age, to sexual contact, to wit: touching G.C.\u2019s breasts,\n        a sexual or intimate part of G.C., said act of youth being contrary to the\n        statutes in such cases made and provided and against the peace and\n        dignity of the State of Oregon.\u201d\n    4\n      Counts 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 were dismissed by the juvenile court at the time of\njurisdiction.\n\fCite as 339 Or App 134 (2025)                            139\n\nhe engaged in intercourse with his 6-year-old half-sister and\nthat he attempted to forcibly compel his 12-year-old cousin\nto touch his penis. We necessarily presume that the juvenile\ncourt determined that there was a factual basis for those\ncharges when it took youth\u2019s Alford pleas.\n         The juvenile court placed youth on probation for\nfive years with conditions that required him to, among other\nthings, obey all laws, abstain from using or possessing con-\ntrolled substances and alcohol, enter and complete sex-\noffender treatment, and not have contact with minor children.\n         Youth began treatment specifically designed for\njuvenile sexual offenders and he was \u201cpretty solid\u201d in that\nprogram for the first eighteen months. By all accounts,\nyouth was \u201cengaged\u201d in all aspects of his probation, includ-\ning treatment, during that initial time period. But youth\u2019s\nengagement with treatment fell off after he left his grand-\nmother\u2019s home at age 18. He often missed scheduled ther-\napy appointments and meetings with his probation officer.\nYouth submitted to various polygraph examinations, but\nthe results were generally inconclusive, and at one point, he\ntested positive for marijuana and methamphetamine. Youth\ndid not complete sex offender treatment. Consequently, the\ncourt found youth to be in violation of probation. It revoked\nhis probation, sanctioned him with \u201ctime served,\u201d and effec-\ntively ended his period of supervision.\n        Youth sought relief from reporting as a sex offender\npursuant to ORS 163A.030. The hearing began before\none judge in June 2022, but it was discontinued and reset\nto begin before a second judge who conducted the hear-\ning over the course of several days beginning in October\n2022 and concluding in January 2023. Witnesses included\nyouth, Dr. Crossen (licensed psychologist who completed an\nupdated psychosexual evaluation concerning youth), Sean\nClark (youth\u2019s therapist), and Rebecca Newmann (youth\u2019s\nprobation officer).\n        Youth testified that he did not complete treatment,\nand he acknowledged that his failure to complete treatment\nresulted in the revocation of his probation. He testified that\nhe had been given a chance to \u201cre-enroll in [treatment]\n\f140                                             State v. B. J. P.\n\nservices\u201d but that he opted not to do so. Youth identified a\nset of photographs that he took of treatment workbook pages\nthat he kept in a binder. He testified that the handwriting\non those pages included that of his therapist, Clark, his\nprobation officer, Newmann, his dad, and his own \u201cchicken\nscratch.\u201d Clark or Newmann would initial the pages as\nyouth completed the work. He testified that the treatment\nchecklist at the back of the binder contained initials on all\nbut the three items that he did not complete: \u201ccomplete all of\nthe assignments,\u201d \u201ccomplete victim awareness assignment,\u201d\nand \u201ccomplete clarification/apology letter.\u201d Youth testified\nthat he did not write any letters to the victims. In partic-\nular, he testified that because he gave Alford pleas on two\nof the counts, a letter of apology or clarification would not\n\u201chave fit [his] specific needs.\u201d He also did not send a letter to\nthe victim in the count that he admitted.\n        Dr. Crossen testified that she completed youth\u2019s\n\u201cupdated psychosexual evaluation.\u201d Her report was received\nin evidence. The 30-page report details Crossen\u2019s findings\nand conclusions, and she testified about those findings at\nthe hearing. In particular, Crossen concluded,\n   \u201cOverall, [youth\u2019s] current estimate of sex offense recidi-\n   vism is low, and therefore the public would not be offered\n   any additional protection by requiring [youth] to register\n   as a sex offender.\u201d\nCrossen offered her opinion that although youth did not com-\nplete his treatment program, he \u201chas a low need for interven-\ntions at this time.\u201d Indeed, Crossen testified that the sexual\nrecidivism rate for juveniles is very low and that \u201cthe risk\nof re-offending is within the first three years after getting\ncaught.\u201d Crossen testified that various studies address juve-\nnile sexual recidivism rates, and that the Caldwell article\nin particular places that rate at 2.75 percent. Youth rested\nafter Crossen\u2019s testimony, and the hearing was continued to\na date approximately one month later.\n         When the hearing continued the next month, youth\noffered the Caldwell article into evidence. The state objected\nbecause youth had rested the month before and had not\ngiven it a copy of the article until the morning it was offered,\n\fCite as 339 Or App 134 (2025)                                    141\n\njust as the state was about to present its evidence. The court\nruled as follows:\n       \u201cIt gets more awkward when we go into these non\u2014\n   these hearings without evidentiary rules, though, when the\n   evidence code doesn\u2019t apply, it\u2019s harder\u2014it\u2019s harder because\n   most of this stuff needs to come in. But I really don\u2019t want\n   to come back in 2025 and still be litigating this case, so the\n   study itself is not going to come in except for purposes of an\n   offer of proof, if we can keep the testimony about what this\n   study says to ten to fifteen minutes, I will allow it. However,\n   beyond\u2014and I\u2019m allowing it in part because I don\u2019t know\n   that it\u2019s going to make a huge difference to the outcome of\n   this case. Beyond that, though, [youth\u2019s counsel], if this is\n   going to be, you know, an hour worth of testimony on this\n   new issue, I don\u2019t think I can go there because I really don\u2019t\n   want to be still here in three years.\u201d\n         The state then called its witnesses, Clark and\nNewmann. Newmann testified that, other than the conduct\nto which youth admitted at the time of jurisdiction, she was\n\u201caware of no hands-on sexual offenses by [youth].\u201d She fur-\nther testified that youth struggled with the \u201caccountability\u201d\npart of the treatment program, at least in part, because\nhe had not admitted to the underlying conduct. Clark and\nNewmann both confirmed that youth had not completed\ntreatment and that, because of that, his probation had been\nrevoked.\n        The parties agree that the purpose of the hearing\nin question was to determine whether youth, who had been\nadjudicated for felony sex crimes as a juvenile offender,\nwould be required to report as a sex offender under ORS\n163A.030. ORS 163A.030(1) provides, as pertinent:\n   \u201c[T]he juvenile court shall hold a hearing on the issue of\n   reporting as a sex offender by a person who has been found\n   to be within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court under ORS\n   419C.005 * * * for having committed an act that if commit-\n   ted by an adult would constitute a felony sex crime[.]\u201d\nThe statute describes the various procedural and eviden-\ntiary requirements for such hearings and, in particular,\nORS 163A.030(7)(b) describes the burden of proof as follows:\n\f142                                                State v. B. J. P.\n\n      \u201cThe person who is the subject of the hearing has the\n   burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that\n   the person is rehabilitated and does not pose a threat to the\n   safety of the public. If the court finds that the person has\n   not met the burden of proof, the court shall enter an order\n   requiring the person to report as a sex offender under ORS\n   163A.025.\u201d\nAs the Supreme Court explained,\n   \u201cwhether a youth must report as a sex offender under ORS\n   163A.030 depends on a factual inquiry. The youth bears\n   the burden to prove that it is highly probable that they\n   have undergone a process of rehabilitation and do not pres-\n   ent a risk of committing future sex offenses. * * * [T]he juve-\n   nile court may order the youth to report as a sex offender\n   only when it finds that those asserted facts are not highly\n   probable.\u201d\nA. R. H., 371 Or at 95. \u201c[A] youth\u2019s pre-adjudication conduct\nalone will not necessarily permit a finding that the youth\nhas failed to prove * * * that the youth is rehabilitated and\nnot a threat to the safety of the public.\u201d Id. at 88.\n       ORS 163A.030(9) establishes relevance as the\nstandard for admitting evidence in hearings to determine\nwhether a youth must report as a sex offender:\n   \u201c* * * [T]he juvenile court may receive testimony, reports\n   and other evidence, without regard to whether the evidence\n   is admissible under [OEC 100] to [OEC 412] and [OEC 601]\n   to [OEC 1008], if the evidence is relevant evidence related\n   to the determination and findings required under this sec-\n   tion. As used in this subsection, \u2018relevant evidence\u2019 has the\n   meaning given that term in [OEC 401].\u201d\nThat relatively low evidentiary bar is consistent with the\nprocedural flexibility built into delinquency hearings, and\nthe well-settled principles that juvenile proceedings are not\ncriminal trials, State v. R. J. S., 318 Or App 351, 354, 506\nP3d 1151, rev den, 370 Or 211 (2022), and delinquency adju-\ndications are not criminal convictions, ORS 419C.400(5).\nImportantly, though, ORS 163A.030(9) describes what the\njuvenile court \u201cmay\u201d receive; it does not describe what must\nbe received.\n\fCite as 339 Or App 134 (2025)                             143\n\n         As an initial matter, to the extent that youth argues\non appeal that he had no discovery obligation to disclose the\nexhibits at issue before the start of the hearing, that argu-\nment is not preserved, and it is not plain or obvious that it\nis correct. We assume, for current purposes, that a hear-\ning under ORS 163A.030 to determine whether an adjudi-\ncated youth must report as a sex offender is a stage in a\nproceeding within the juvenile court\u2019s exclusive delinquency\njurisdiction under ORS 419C.005. That means that ORS\n419C.270 applies to the proceeding except to the extent the\nspecific provisions of ORS 163A.030 indicate otherwise. And\nwhile ORS 163A.030(9) makes many of the provisions of the\nOregon Evidence Code inapplicable to those hearings, cer-\ntain criminal procedures nevertheless apply in delinquency\nproceedings, and ORS 163A.030 does not speak to the issue\nof discovery but ORS 419C.270 does. Among other things,\nORS 419C.270(6) applies ORS 135.835, ORS 135.845, and\nORS 135.865 to delinquency proceedings.\n         ORS 135.835(3) requires the defendant to \u201cdisclose\nto\u201d the prosecuting attorney \u201c[a]ny books, papers, docu-\nments, photographs or tangible objects that the defense\nintends to offer in evidence at the trial\u201d that are \u201cwithin the\npossession or control of the defense.\u201d ORS 135.845 makes\nthose obligations of disclosure time sensitive, requiring that\ndisclosure occur \u201cas soon as practicable following the filing\u201d\nof the charging instrument, and subjecting the parties to\nongoing duties of disclosure for additional materials that\n\u201ca party finds, either before or during trial[.]\u201d ORS 135.865\nprovides the trial court with sanctions that it may impose\nfor discovery violations including ordering \u201cthe violating\nparty to permit inspection of the material, or grant[ing] a\ncontinuance, or refus[ing] to permit the witness to testify,\nor refus[ing] to receive in evidence the material not dis-\nclosed, or enter[ing] such other order as it considers appro-\npriate.\u201d Thus, because youth did not preserve the issue and\nbecause, as we have explained, it is not obvious that youth\nis correct that no statutory discovery obligations apply in a\nhearing under ORS 163A.030, we assume, without decid-\ning, that ORS 419C.270(6), which governs discovery obliga-\ntions in delinquency cases, applies to hearings under ORS\n163A.030, which does not address discovery obligations,\n\f144                                                          State v. B. J. P.\n\nbecause doing so allows us to give effect to both statutes.5\nSee Powers v. Quigley, 345 Or 432, 438, 198 P3d 919 (2008)\n(\u201c[I]f the court can give full effect to both statutes, it will do\nso, and if not, it will treat the specific statute as an exception\nto the general.\u201d).\n         Youth argues that the Caldwell article, Exhibit\n110, was relevant to the key issues of his rehabilitation\nand whether he poses a threat to the safety of the public.\n\u201cThe crux\u201d of the Caldwell article, according to youth, was\nthat it identified the rate of sexual recidivism in individu-\nals like youth. The article is clearly relevant, but the state\ndoes not dispute that, and the juvenile court did not exclude\nthe Caldwell article on relevance grounds. It ultimately\nexcluded the article after this discussion with counsel:\n        \u201c[PROSECUTOR]: So, Your Honor, this was just pro-\n    vided to me this morning, the testimony was last month, I\n    haven\u2019t had a chance to read it, Dr. Crossen testified about\n    it, given that it\u2019s essentially late discovery, there was tes-\n    timony from the Defense expert in relation to that, I would\n    object to just the study being entered into the record due to\n    the discovery I guess late violation as well as Dr. Crossen\u2019s\n    already testified to what she wanted in relation to that and\n    the State would not have time to prepare or to look at any\n    contradicting studies or be able to have a conversation with\n    anybody related to that study.\n        \u201cTHE COURT: [Counsel for youth]?\n       \u201c[YOUTH\u2019S COUNSEL]:           * * * [C]ounsel[ ] had the\n    opportunity to cross-examine Dr. Crossen, also this study\n    she referred to * * * has to do with the very decision that\n    Your Honor is making, which is the recidivism rate gen-\n    erally and then the fact that my client fits within that\n    category of adolescents, so I would think that under the\n\n    5\n      We acknowledge that ORS 135.835 and ORS 135.845 refer to \u201cthe fil-\ning of an indictment or information,\u201d \u201cthe defense,\u201d and \u201cthe trial.\u201d But ORS\n419C.270(6) makes those provisions applicable to delinquency proceedings under\nORS 419C.005, and given that, we assume that those terms must be read to make\nsense in that context as references, respectively, to delinquency petitions, youth,\nand fact-finding hearings. We likewise read those provisions to make sense in\nthe context of delinquency hearings under ORS 163A.030 as references to peti-\ntions for relief from reporting requirements, youth, and the fact-finding hearing\nrequired by ORS 163A.030. As noted, youth did not preserve any argument that\nthere is no statutory discovery process that applies to ORS 163A.030 hearings.\nThat issue is not before us and we do not decide it.\n\fCite as 339 Or App 134 (2025)                                 145\n\n  very loose rule of evidence in a disposition-type hearing in\n  juvenile that anything that would be useful to the Court to\n  have these * * * would certainly fall within that category of\n  relevance.\n     \u201cTHE COURT: I\u2019m going to go ahead and receive the\n  exhibit, but if you want to cross-examine Dr. Crossen addi-\n  tionally, [prosecutor], if you want some additional time\u2014\n      \u201c[PROSECUTOR]: And so Your Honor is essentially\n  saying, hey, you know, we\u2019re\u2014this is day five of this hear-\n  ing, Dr. Crossen at the first hearing testified to that study,\n  it wasn\u2019t provided to the State, so now we\u2019re here on month\n  11, I think, and we\u2019re getting brand new discovery from the\n  Defense, so I can\u2019t possibly make a decision of potentially\n  need[ing] more time when we have victims who have been\n  waiting for this determination as well as I\u2019m sure [youth]\n  as well and we\u2019re getting new stuff from the Defense, which\n  is the State like\u2014\n     \u201cTHE COURT: Why wasn\u2019t it given to [the prosecutor]\n  earlier?\n      \u201c[YOUTH\u2019S COUNSEL]: I just, I asked Dr. Crossen for\n  it because she talked about it repeatedly because I wanted\n  to read it, so I looked at it and I thought it would be use-\n  ful, I just didn\u2019t prepare it for today, so it\u2019s not something\n  that, you know, I thought about other than, as I said, I\u2019m\n  just saying I think it\u2019s highly relevant to the decision Your\n  Honor\u2019s making, it\u2019s just, you know, it is being provided to\n  the Court today, so\u2014\n     \u201c[PROSECUTOR]: And so, Your Honor, that study is\n  referenced in Dr. Crossen\u2019s report from I believe April, so\n  that\u2019s when [youth\u2019s counsel] would have learned of it and\n  would have had the opportunity to do that, we were here in\n  June, we talked about it then, I just, I think it\u2019s manifestly\n  unfair to the State to come in on this\u2014on a bifurcated\n  hearing to have, hey, here\u2019s new information that you pre-\n  viously didn\u2019t have that I\u2019m going to submit as an exhibit\n  without giving you the opportunity to review or be able to\n  address it in any capacity. There I have to feel like there\n  has to be some limit on\u2014\n     \u201cTHE COURT: Yeah, and you\u2019re right\u2014\n     \u201c[PROSECUTOR]: \u2014on when the Defense and just\n  history on this case, Your Honor, when we were in front of\n\f146                                              State v. B. J. P.\n\n   [a different judge], on day two of that hearing the Defense\n   provided the State with what has been admitted as treat-\n   ment notes, so this is something that\u2019s been habitual in\n   this case, I\u2019m afraid if we set this over again the Defense\n   will provide additional exhibits and additional materials\n   every single time we come back\u2014\n      \u201cTHE COURT: The last thing I want to do is set this\n   over again, I will not, I will change my mind on that, I will\n   not receive the exhibit[.]\u201d\nThe parties characterize the trial court\u2019s decision to exclude\nthe Caldwell article as a discovery sanction, but they dis-\nagree about whether it was a proper exercise of the court\u2019s\ndiscretion.\n         We agree that the juvenile court excluded the\nCaldwell article as a discovery violation sanction. As we\nalready explained, youth had an obligation to disclose any\ntangible exhibits that he planned to offer at the hearing,\nand that obligation was ongoing as to \u201cadditional material\nor information\u201d that he became aware of as the hearing pro-\nceeded. The obligation is time-sensitive, requiring prompt\nnotice of any new material. The disclosure obligation is trig-\ngered when a party can \u201creasonably predict\u201d that he will\nintroduce the evidence. See State v. Young, 94 Or App 683,\n689, 767 P2d 90 (1989).\n          Youth is correct that, under OEC 705, an expert may\ntestify to their opinion \u201cand give reasons therefor without\nprior disclosure of the underlying facts or data.\u201d However,\nand as happened here, \u201c[t]he expert may in any event be\nrequired to disclose the underlying facts or data on cross-\nexamination.\u201d OEC 705. Once youth became aware of the\nCaldwell article through Crossen\u2019s testimony and decided to\noffer it as an exhibit, he had a duty to promptly notify the\nstate of his intent to do so. Given that youth had finished\npresenting his case-in-chief and had rested without offering\nthe Caldwell article into evidence, it was not error for the\njuvenile court to conclude that he violated his ongoing dis-\ncovery obligation by not notifying the state that he intended\nto offer the article as an exhibit. Indeed, youth waited for\nthe state to begin presenting its evidence, a month later,\nand then offered the exhibit with no notice at all.\n\fCite as 339 Or App 134 (2025)                              147\n\n         The sanctions available to the juvenile court under\nORS 135.865 ranged from granting a continuance to exclud-\ning the Caldwell article. It is apparent that the court consid-\nered a continuance but determined that exclusion was more\nappropriate under the circumstances. We cannot say that\nthe court abused its discretion, especially given the length\nof time that had passed since youth filed his petition, and\nCrossen\u2019s extensive testimony about the Caldwell article.\n         Youth offered the Kettrey article, Exhibit 112, which\naddresses whether individuals like youth must complete\ntreatment to \u201cfall into the low recidivism category,\u201d during\nhis rebuttal case when he recalled Crossen. Again, the state\ndoes not dispute the relevance of the Kettrey article. After\nhearing from the parties, the juvenile court stated that if it\nwere to \u201ccontinue to receive new exhibits every single [day]\n* * * we will never get this hearing * * * done.\u201d The court\nlater clarified that it would allow Crossen to testify about\nwhether completing a treatment program impacts recidi-\nvism, but that the Kettrey article itself would be excluded.\nWe conclude that the juvenile court did not abuse its discre-\ntion in excluding the Kettrey article for the same reasons it\ndid not abuse its discretion in excluding the Caldwell article.\n         Youth offered a binder of the original workbook\npages from his sex offender treatment program as Exhibit\n111 when he presented his rebuttal case. But youth had,\nin his case-in-chief, already successfully offered Exhibit\n109, which consisted of photographs that he testified he\nhad taken of the pages in his treatment workbook that\nhe had kept in a binder. When questioned about Exhibit\n109 on cross-examination, youth testified that he thought\nExhibit 109 was a complete copy of his notebook but, when\npressed about that, he indicated that he was not certain. His\ntherapist, Clark, later testified that a treatment checklist\nincluded in youth\u2019s Exhibit 109 looked \u201codd\u201d to him because,\namong other reasons, it was \u201cpretty much completely signed\noff\u201d even though he would not typically sign off on such a list\nuntil the end of treatment, which youth did not complete.\n         Youth offered Exhibit 111 to rebut the suggestion\nthat he had \u201cforged\u201d the treatment checklist. In particu-\nlar, he offered Exhibit 111 as \u201crelevant for Your Honor to\n\f148                                              State v. B. J. P.\n\nsee some other original initialings also in the notebook\ndone by Mr. Clark.\u201d The primary focus of the state\u2019s cross-\nexamination of youth about Exhibit 109 was on the check-\nlist. The juvenile court separated the original checklist from\nthe proffered exhibit and received it as Exhibit 113, ruling:\n   \u201cI am going to receive the original of the treatment check-\n   list, I\u2019m not going to receive the originals of anything else\n   * * * that\u2019s duplicative.\u201d\nThe juvenile court, as trier of fact, heard the testimony of\nyouth and Clark concerning the treatment binder, and it\nhad received Exhibits 109 and 113, showing photographs\nof the workbook and the original treatment checklist.\nTherefore, the juvenile court received the original checklist\nthat was at issue during youth\u2019s cross-examination, permit-\nting it to assess the document\u2019s authenticity, and it other-\nwise excluded the portions of the notebook that were dupli-\ncative of the photographs provided in Exhibit 109. Even if,\nfor the purpose of argument only, it was error for the court\nto exclude the rest of Exhibit 111, the evidence excluded was\n\u201cmerely cumulative of admitted evidence\u201d and therefore, its\nexclusion was harmless. State v. Jasperse, 310 Or App 703,\n711, 487 P3d 402, rev den, 368 Or 787 (2021) (internal quo-\ntation marks omitted).\n        Turning, finally, to the juvenile court\u2019s conclusion\nthat youth failed to meet his burden under ORS 163A.030\nand that he must, therefore, report as a sex offender, the\ncourt explained its ruling from the bench as follows:\n       \u201cOn this record, the alleged acts, two of the counts of\n   which he took Alford pleas, one of the counts which he\n   admitted, they\u2019re fairly serious alleged offenses, we have\n   multiple victims, two of whom have significant age gap, at\n   least at the time, between themselves and [youth]. And on\n   this record I feel like I have more questions than answers.\n   I have questions about the youth\u2019s credibility, I have ques-\n   tions about what really happened to the victims, I have\n   questions about why the youth didn\u2019t complete treatment, I\n   have questions about why the youth didn\u2019t at least complete\n   the empathy assignments, the clarification assignments as\n   to the victim that he admitted, I have questions about why\n   the youth seems to minimize what happened even to the\n   victim that he acknowledges, I have questions about why\n\fCite as 339 Or App 134 (2025)                               149\n\n   the youth wasn\u2019t able to better articulate things that he\n   learned in treatment.\n      \u201cI think given those questions and I think given the\n   static factors, I think as [youth\u2019s counsel] has typically\n   described them in other cases, it does pain me, but I find\n   that the youth has not proven by clear and convincing evi-\n   dence that he is rehabilitated and does not pose a safety\n   threat to the public[.]\u201d\nIn its written order, the juvenile court found that \u201cyouth\nhas not proven, by clear and convincing evidence, that he or\nshe is rehabilitated and does not pose a safety threat to the\npublic.\u201d\n         We acknowledge that, when making its oral ruling,\nthe court stated its findings in terms of \u201cquestions\u201d that it\nhad about the nature of the underlying juvenile offenses,\nyouth\u2019s present day credibility, why youth continued to min-\nimize the effect of his offenses on the victims, why he did not\ncomplete treatment\u2014in particular his failure to complete\nthe empathy and clarification assignments\u2014and why youth\ncould not articulate what he had learned in treatment. By\nnoting the many questions it had at the conclusion of the\nhearing, we understand the juvenile court to have been\nexplaining the weaknesses it found in youth\u2019s case and con-\nnecting those weaknesses to youth\u2019s current risk of sexual\nrecidivism. In its explanation, the court relied on risk factors\nthat included youth\u2019s recent failure to complete treatment,\nwhich included, in part, his ongoing refusal to work with the\nvictims vis-\u00e0-vis clarification and empathy assignments. The\nfact that youth entered Alford pleas to two of the charged\noffenses does not explain or excuse his present-day refusal\nto complete treatment, and it did not require the juvenile\ncourt to ignore his treatment deficiencies. First, youth failed\nto complete the clarification and empathy assignments even\nwith respect to the victim of the offense to which he offered\nhis outright admission. And second, youth\u2019s decision not to\ncontest two of the charges and to necessarily accept being\nadjudicated on those charges does not explain his refusal to\ncomplete treatment, his resulting violation of probation, or\nhis decision to opt out of treatment even when it was again\noffered to him. Also, the juvenile court was free to accept or\nreject the expert testimony it heard about sexual recidivism\n\f150                                          State v. B. J. P.\n\nrates and treatment. See Kotler and Winnett, 282 Or App\n584, 598, 385 P3d 1200 (2016) (explaining that a witness\u2019s\n\u201ctestimony was not entitled to greater weight simply because\n[the witness] is an expert; as with all conflicting evidence,\nthe probative value of such evidence is solely for the trial\ncourt to determine\u201d). Given all that, we cannot say that the\nrecord compelled the court to conclude other than it did.\n        Affirmed.\n\f",

J.\n         Youth appeals a juvenile court order denying his\npetition to dismiss jurisdiction. In his petition, youth sought\npost-adjudication relief, under both the state and federal con-\nstitutions, on a claim under ORS 419C.615(1)(a)1 that his trial\ncounsel was constitutionally inadequate and ineffective in fail-\ning to move to suppress statements that youth made to police,\nand that, had those statements been suppressed, he would\nnot have admitted to conduct that, if committed by an adult,\nwould constitute one count of second-degree sexual abuse, ORS\n163.425, and one count of strangulation, ORS 163.187.\n         On appeal, youth raises one assignment of error,\nin which he contends that the juvenile court erred in deny-\ning his petition to dismiss jurisdiction, as trial counsel was\ninadequate and ineffective in failing to file a motion to sup-\npress youth\u2019s statements to police. Accepting the juvenile\ncourt\u2019s supported implicit and explicit factual findings and\nreviewing for legal error, State v. C. L. E., 316 Or App 5, 6,\n502 P3d 1154 (2021), we affirm.\n         In evaluating whether youth was entitled to post-\nadjudication relief under ORS 419C.615(1)(a), \u201cwe apply\nthe constitutional standards for inadequate and ineffec-\ntive assistance of counsel that have been developed at the\nstate and federal level in the context of post-conviction and\nhabeas corpus relief.\u201d State v. J. J.-M., 282 Or App 459, 463,\n387 P3d 426 (2016). To prevail on a claim of inadequate and\nineffective assistance of counsel under those constitutional\nstandards, youth must have proved both a performance and\na prejudice prong. Id. at 464; see also Johnson v. Premo, 315\nOr App 1, 8, 499 P3d 814 (2021) (stating the \u201cfunctionally\nequivalent\u201d standards for inadequate and ineffective assis-\ntance of counsel under the state and federal constitutions).\n     1\n       ORS 419C.615 provides, as relevant:\n          \u201c(1) In addition to any other grounds upon which a person may petition\n     a court under ORS 419C.610, a person may petition the court on the following\n     grounds to set aside an order finding the person to be within the jurisdiction\n     of the court under ORS 419C.005:\n          \u201c(a) A substantial denial in the proceedings resulting in the person\u2019s\n     adjudication, or in the appellate review of the adjudication, of the person\u2019s\n     rights under the United States Constitution or the Oregon Constitution, or\n     both, and the denial rendered the adjudication void[.]\u201d\n\fCite as 339 Or App 35 (2025)                                 37\n\n         Youth argues that the juvenile court erred when it\ndenied youth relief on his claim of inadequate and ineffec-\ntive assistance of counsel. As youth sees it, his trial coun-\nsel\u2019s performance was deficient because youth \u201chad a meri-\ntorious argument that his statements [to police] should have\nbeen suppressed\u201d but trial counsel \u201cdid not see a suppression\nissue.\u201d The state responds that \u201cyouth failed to prove that\nhis attorney performed deficiently by pursuing an early,\nfavorable resolution rather than filing a motion to suppress\u201d\nor that \u201cthe alleged deficient performance resulted in preju-\ndice.\u201d We address each prong\u2014the performance prong and\nthe prejudice prong\u2014in turn.\n          Regarding the performance prong, it was youth\u2019s\nburden to prove that \u201c \u2018counsel\u2019s decision reflects an absence\nof professional skill and judgment, a question that turns on\nthe facts known at the time that counsel made that deci-\nsion.\u2019 \u201d C. L. E., 316 Or App at 10 (quoting Davis v. Kelly, 303\nOr App 253, 262, 461 P3d 1043, rev den, 366 Or 826 (2020)).\n         Applying that standard here, the record reflects\nthat trial counsel\u2019s decision not to pursue suppression of\nyouth\u2019s statements to police did not reflect an absence of\nprofessional skill and judgment. Youth\u2019s trial counsel testi-\nfied at the hearing on the petition to set aside jurisdiction\nthat she had viewed the evidence of the police interrogation\nof youth and opined that it \u201clooked like a revocation of any\ninvoking of his right to remain silent.\u201d That is, suppression\nof youth\u2019s statements was unlikely to be successful, because,\nalthough youth invoked his right to remain silent, he sub-\nsequently spoke to police after receiving Miranda warnings,\nand he was also evaluated by a doctor who concluded that\nthere were no concerns regarding youth\u2019s ability to under-\nstand his Miranda rights. See State v. McAnulty, 356 Or 432,\n458, 338 P3d 653 (2014) (explaining that when a suspect has\ninvoked their right to remain silent, \u201cpolice may reinitiate\ncontact after a reasonable time, provide new Miranda warn-\nings, and obtain a valid waiver\u201d). We do not understand this\nto be a case where youth\u2019s trial counsel simply failed to \u201csee\u201d\na meritorious legal issue, as youth contends.\n         Further, trial counsel\u2019s testimony reflects that other\nfactors in youth\u2019s case bore on trial counsel\u2019s decision not to\n\f38                                           State v. D. W. N.\n\npursue suppression, including that the state would revoke\nits plea offer on the filing of that motion and might charge\nyouth as an adult; that a successful motion would likely lead\nto a trial on the more serious charge of first-degree rape;\nthat the victim was \u201cadamant\u201d about the case going to trial;\nthat the state would still have the victim\u2019s statements as\nevidence even if youth\u2019s statements were suppressed; and\nthat youth would not be able to testify even if his statements\nwere suppressed to avoid \u201copening the door\u201d to admission of\nthose suppressed statements. In addition, an affidavit sub-\nmitted by the prosecutor in youth\u2019s case averred that, had\nthe trial court \u201centertained a suppression of [youth\u2019s state-\nments to police], the [plea] offer would have been immedi-\nately revoked and the state would have proceeded to trial on\nall the allegations in the original petition.\u201d The prosecutor\nfurther averred that, had a motion to suppress been granted,\n\u201cthe state would have absolutely proceeded to trial without\nyouth\u2019s statements[,]\u201d because the remaining evidence, in\nthe prosecutor\u2019s view, \u201cwould have been sufficiently compel-\nling to prove the allegations beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d\n         Thus, we conclude that trial counsel\u2019s decision not to\npursue suppression of youth\u2019s statements was not deficient\nbecause it was a strategic decision and a reasonable exercise\nof professional skill and judgment in response to the circum-\nstances. See, e.g., Gorham v. Thompson, 332 Or 560, 567, 34\nP3d 161 (2001) (explaining that \u201ca reviewing court will not\nsecond-guess a lawyer\u2019s tactical decisions in the name of the\nconstitution unless those decisions reflect an absence or sus-\npension of professional skill and judgment\u201d).\n         But even if that trial counsel\u2019s performance was\ndeficient, we conclude that there was no prejudice. Under\nthe prejudice prong, we \u201cfocus[ ] on whether trial counsel\u2019s\nconstitutionally inadequate performance affected the out-\ncome of the plea process\u201d in cases such as this one \u201cwhere\nthe adjudication is based on a plea.\u201d C. L. E., 316 Or App at\n16. To establish prejudice, youth was required to \u201cshow that\nbut for the inadequate and ineffective assistance, he would\nhave pleaded differently.\u201d Id.\n         The evidence that youth offered to prove prejudice\nis his written declaration in which he attests that, had trial\n\fCite as 339 Or App 35 (2025)                                                     39\n\ncounsel moved to suppress his statements, he \u201cwould not\nhave accepted the plea agreement\u201d and \u201cwould not have\nentered admissions[.]\u201d However, the juvenile court was per-\nmitted to make a determination that youth was not credible.\nConsequently, we conclude that youth did not prove that he\nwas prejudiced by trial counsel\u2019s failure to move to suppress\nhis statements.2\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n       The juvenile court did not explain its reason for denying youth\u2019s petition;\nthat is, it did not indicate whether the denial was based on a determination that\nyouth had failed to meet the performance prong of his claim, the prejudice prong\nof his claim, or both.\n     Youth contends that \u201cbecause the trial court could have denied relief without\nreaching the issue of prejudice, this court should reverse and remand for the\ncourt to consider youth\u2019s evidence [regarding prejudice] in the first instance.\u201d\n     For this court to perform its review function, it is helpful when a lower court\nexplains the basis for its ruling. As the Supreme Court stated in Datt v. Hill,\n347 Or 672, 684, 227 P3d 714 (2010), \u201c[i]t is a truism, and an important one,\nthat a post-conviction trial court can be of great assistance to appellate courts\nby making findings of historical facts and explaining how its conclusions derive\nfrom those findings.\u201d That is, \u201c[a]n understanding of how a post-conviction trial\ncourt actually, rather than presumptively, arrived at its decision enhances the\neffectiveness of appellate review.\u201d Id. at 685; see also Pereida-Alba v. Coursey, 356\nOr 654, 670-71, 342 P3d 70 (2015) (noting that \u201cwe presume that a trial court\nimplicitly resolves factual disputes consistently with its ultimate conclusion\u201d but\nthat \u201c[i]f an implicit factual finding is not necessary to a trial court\u2019s ultimate\nconclusion * * *, then the presumption does not apply\u201d). We think the important\n\u201ctruism\u201d that the Supreme Court observed in Datt applies equally to a claim\nfor post-adjudication relief under ORS 419C.615(1)(a)\u2014the kind of claim at issue\nin this appeal\u2014as it does to a claim seeking relief under the Post-Conviction\nHearings Act\u2014the kind of claim at issue in Datt.\n     In any event, for purposes of our analysis, we have assumed that the juvenile\ncourt denied youth\u2019s motion on either the performance prong, the prejudice prong,\nor both; and, as set forth above, the record was sufficient for the juvenile court\nto have denied youth\u2019s motion on either (or both) of those bases. Remand for the\njuvenile court to address the prejudice prong in the first instance is unnecessary.\nCf. Dickerson v. Fhuere, 316 Or App 62, 67, 501 P3d 1072 (2021) (reversing and\nremanding \u201cbecause the post-conviction court\u2019s decision was based on an error\nof law and, as a result of that error, the court never made the factual determina-\ntions necessary to allow for resolution of petitioner\u2019s claim under the correct legal\nstandard\u201d).\n\f",

In addition, an affidavit sub-\nmitted by the prosecutor in youth\u2019s case averred that, had\nthe trial court \u201centertained a suppression of [youth\u2019s state-\nments to police], the [plea] offer would have been immedi-\nately revoked and the state would have proceeded to trial on\nall the allegations in the original petition.\u201d The prosecutor\nfurther averred that, had a motion to suppress been granted,\n\u201cthe state would have absolutely proceeded to trial without\nyouth\u2019s statements[,]\u201d because the remaining evidence, in\nthe prosecutor\u2019s view, \u201cwould have been sufficiently compel-\nling to prove the allegations beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d\n         Thus, we conclude that trial counsel\u2019s decision not to\npursue suppression of youth\u2019s statements was not deficient\nbecause it was a strategic decision and a reasonable exercise\nof professional skill and judgment in response to the circum-\nstances.

As we explain below, defendant did not do so\nand we, therefore, reject his first assignment as unpreserved.\n         The trial court, on defendant\u2019s request, severed the\nvarious charges into two trials: one for charges connected to\na pair of coffee shop robberies, and one for charges related to\nburglaries at a credit union and a Fred Meyer store.

BRYANT DONALDSON, JR.\n\n                 Appeal from the Criminal Court for Wilson County\n                     No. 20-CR-119     Brody N.

After a sentencing hearing, the trial court\nimposed an effective twenty-three-year sentence. Defendant appeals, arguing that the trial\ncourt erred in admitting his psychosexual evaluation and a victim impact statement at\nsentencing and that the trial court misapplied enhancement factors. Upon our review of\nthe entire record, the briefs of the parties, and the applicable law, we affirm the judgments\nof the trial court.\n\n Tenn. R. App. P. 3 Appeal as of Right; Judgments of the Criminal Court Affirmed\n\nJILL BARTEE AYERS, J., delivered the opinion of the court, in which ROBERT L.\nHOLLOWAY, JR., and ROBERT H. MONTGOMERY, JR., JJ., joined.\n\nDaniel J. Turklay, Lebanon, Tennessee, for the appellant, Bryant Donaldson, Jr.\n\nJonathan Skrmetti, Attorney General and Reporter; Ryan Dugan, Assistant Attorney\nGeneral; Jason Lawson, District Attorney General; and Thomas Harwell Swink, Assistant\nDistrict Attorney General, for the appellee, State of Tennessee.\n\n                                        OPINION\n\n                          Factual and Procedural Background\n\n       On February 12, 2020, Defendant was indicted for one count of especially\naggravated sexual exploitation of a minor (count one), six counts of statutory rape by an\nauthority figure (counts two through seven), and six counts of aggravated statutory rape\n(counts eight through thirteen). The case proceeded to trial on July 27, 2021. After the\nState completed voir dire, a plea agreement was reached. Pursuant to the plea agreement,\n\fDefendant pled guilty to counts one and eight through thirteen in exchange for the dismissal\nof counts two through seven. The trial court would determine the length and manner of\nsentence. We note that the appellate record does not contain a transcript of trial\nproceedings or of Defendant\u2019s plea submission. See State v. Keen, 996 S.W.2d 842, 843-\n44 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1999) (\u201c[A] transcript of the guilty plea hearing is often (if not\nalways) needed in order to conduct a proper review of the sentence imposed.\u201d); Tenn. R.\nApp. P. 24(b) (stating that the appellant has the duty to prepare a record which conveys a\n\u201cfair, accurate and complete account of what transpired with respect to those issues that are\nthe bases of appeal\u201d). An appellate who fails to include the transcript of the guilty plea\nhearing in the record risks waiver of a sentencing issue. This court determines on a case-\nby-case basis whether the record is sufficient for meaningful review without the inclusion\nof the plea submission transcript. State v. Caudle, 388 S.W.3d 273, 279 (Tenn. 2012). In\nthis case, we will consider the merits of Defendant\u2019s sentencing issues because the facts of\nthe offense are sufficiently stated in the presentence report. The relevant facts underlying\nthe plea, as provided in the presentence report, are as follows:\n\n       On January 11, 2020, . . . officers with the Wilson County Sheriff\u2019s\n       Department were dispatched to [the victim\u2019s house regarding] a possible\n       rape. Detectives arrived at the residence, where the 14[-]year[-]old female\n       victim . . . resided with her mother and others, including the victim\u2019s 15[-\n       ]year[-]old sister and [Defendant]. Upon arrival detectives made contact\n       with the victim\u2019s mother, who[] advised that she had checked [the victim\u2019s]\n       phone and found a picture of a penis and a video of [the victim] in a sexual\n       act with [Defendant]. She advised that she recognized the location that the\n       video was taken as in the laundry room . . . . The phone was placed into\n       evidence and the laundry room photographed. At this time the victim was\n       being taken to [S]ummit [H]ospital by her grandmother. Detectives then\n       received a call from Summit Hospital Emergency Room nurse stating that\n       the victim was being transported to Our Kids (Nashville General Hospital)\n       to have a sexual assault kit conducted. After leaving [the victim\u2019s house],\n       deputies transported [Defendant] to the Sheriff\u2019s Department to be\n       interviewed. Detectives met with [Defendant] at the Sheriff\u2019s [D]epartment\n       and upon being advised of his rights[, Defendant] agreed to speak with\n       detectives. [Defendant] was asked about his relationship with the victim and\n       [Defendant] stated that \u201cshe looks up to him\u201d and that they just sit around\n       and talk. [Defendant] was then asked if he had had any sexual contact with\n       the victim and he denied having any sexual relationship with her. Detectives\n       explained the video evidence they ha[d] in which showed [Defendant] and\n       the victim engaging in a sexual act. [Defendant] denied a sexual act and\n       argued that detectives did not have a video of him. He stated that he has only\n       had a parenting[,] role model type relationship with the victim. Upon being\n                                            -2-\n\fasked if he had taken any type of drugs, [Defendant] stated that he takes drugs\non a daily basis and had used earlier the same day but would not elaborate\non what drugs he had taken. It was determined that the subject was under\nthe influence at that time and the interview was stopped. . . .\n\nOn January 13, 2020[,] the victim\u2019s mother stated to detectives that she had\njust found out that her other daughter (K.R.) had also been approached by\n[D]efendant in a sexual manner. A forensic interview was then conducted\nwith the victim at the child advocacy center on the date of January 13, 2020.\nDuring this interview the victim reported that she understood that she is here\nto talk about Bryant \u201cbubba\u201d Donaldson and what happened. She stated that\n[Defendant] is Sierra\u2019s brother (Sierra lives with them). She reported that\nthe incidents started around August of 2019 in which she and [Defendant]\nbegan talking as friends and about a month after things progressed. She\nstated that he would tell her that he loved her, wanted to marry her and have\nkids with her. She stated that a few days prior to the interview they had sex.\nShe stated that her mother went through her phone and found pictures and\nvideo of her and [Defendant]. She stated that her grandmother then drove\nher to Summit Hospital and then to Our Kids. She stated that the incident on\nSaturday was not the only time they had sex, the first time was around August\nor September 2019. She stated that [Defendant] would touch her body all\nover before they had sex (breasts, legs, vagina). She stated that the first time\nthey had sex was in the basement of her mother\u2019s house on the couch. After\nthey had sex, she stated that [Defendant] would digitally penetrate her\nvagina. She stated that he did not use protection when they had sex. She\nreported that they had sex multiple times. She stated that the first time they\nhad sex it did hurt her for a few seconds but did not hurt later. She stated\nthat on Saturday (January 11, 2020) they had sex with him penetrating her\nvaginally standing behind her with her hands on the wall. She stated that she\nperformed oral sex on [Defendant] twice, all incidents did occur in the\nbasement. She stated that everyone else was usually upstairs in the home\nwhen they had sex. When they had sex he would ejaculate both outside and\ninside of her. She stated that after the first time she told her sister (K.R.).\nLater on January 13, 2020[,] the victim\u2019s sister (K.R.) was interviewed at the\nchild advocacy center, with her mother present. K.R. stated that she has\nknown [Defendant] for approximately [ten] years and they refer to him as\n\u201cbubba.\u201d She reported that [Defendant] had moved in with them in June\n2019 but sometimes stays with his sister Brandy in Gordonsville. She stated\nthat [Defendant] does not have a phone, car or a job and is often at home\nwhen everyone else is gone. Upon being asked about the sleeping\narrangements of the household[,] K.R. states that he often slept in her\n                                     -3-\n\f      mother\u2019s room or downstairs in the basement. She stated that everyone else\n      slept in bedrooms on the main floor of the house. She was then asked about\n      the sexual incidents between her sister and [Defendant] and she stated that\n      she had not seen the incidents but described an incident in which the three of\n      them were downstairs and she could hear the victim and [Defendant]\n      whispering. Upon asking what they were whispering about[,] [Defendant]\n      told her that they were making a bet that on whether she (K.R.) would have\n      sex with him or with them. She states that she told them that she wouldn\u2019t\n      and they stopped discussing it. She states that [Defendant] told her that he\n      and the victim were \u201cinterrupted\u201d earlier that day and they were going to\n      finish. She then states that [Defendant] and the victim then went into the\n      victim\u2019s room to \u201cfinish.\u201d She states that this occurred about a week and a\n      half ago. She then spoke of another incident in which they were at\n      [Defendant]\u2019s sister\u2019s house in Gordonsville and she was babysitting his\n      sister\u2019s kids. She states that while they were there he typed \u201cwill you have\n      sex with me, I will give you money or something you want\u201d into his phone\n      and showed it to her. She stated that she again refused. She stated that these\n      were the only times he asked her to do it but that he frequently made \u201csly\n      comments\u201d about it to her. She stated that she had asked the victim about\n      her sexual relationship with [Defendant] and she states that the victim told\n      her that she (the victim) and [Defendant] had had sex \u201ctoo many times to\n      count.\u201d Interviewer then spoke to K.R. about the difficulties of this type of\n      interview and the importance for her to be open and honest and that she was\n      not in any kind of trouble. K.R. then stated that in that case, there was another\n      incident in which one day [Defendant] had yelled at her to come into the\n      laundry room that he had something to tell her and when she went in he began\n      kissing her and he put his hand down her pants and she told him to stop. On\n      May 25, 2020[,] the [Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (\u201cTBI\u201d)] crime lab\n      issued a report indicating their analysis of the sexual assault kit and report\n      revealed the . . . sperm found on the victim\u2019s labia and vaginal swabs were a\n      DNA match to [Defendant].\n\n       On March 21, 2022, the trial court conducted a sentencing hearing. Defendant\u2019s\npresentence report, which included the victim\u2019s mother\u2019s victim impact statement, was\nadmitted into evidence. As noted in the presentence report, Defendant reported that he\n\u201cwas out of [his] mind\u201d when the victim \u201capproached [him] and [he] allowed it to happen.\u201d\nThe report also showed a confirmed gang affiliation and Defendant\u2019s criminal history\nwhich included convictions for aggravated robbery and failure to appear. Regarding his\naggravated robbery conviction, Defendant was sentenced to eight years suspended to\nprobation; following two violations, his probation was revoked. Defendant reported his\nmental health as \u201cpoor\u201d and admitted to alcohol and drug problems. He first drank alcohol\n                                            -4-\n\fat age thirteen, used heroin from 2018 until his arrest in 2020, and used methamphetamine\nand marijuana from \u201c2007 / 2008 until his arrest in 2020.\u201d Defendant reported that his\ndrug and alcohol use contributed to his current charges. Defendant\u2019s Strong-R Risk and\nNeeds Assessment resulted in risk score of \u201chigh.\u201d\n\n       The State then read the victim\u2019s mother\u2019s victim impact statement into the record.\nIn the statement, the victim\u2019s mother expressed that Defendant had \u201ctaken [her] child\u2019s\ninnocence away\u201d and caused the victim to be \u201cfull of anger and rage and hate.\u201d The\nvictim\u2019s mother questioned whether Defendant had \u201cput together a big master plan to use\n[her] so [he] could get to [her] girls[.]\u201d She expressed her belief that this was not an isolated\nincident and \u201cpray[ed] . . . that no little girl is ever around\u201d Defendant again. The victim\u2019s\nmother requested Defendant receive the maximum sentence.\n\n       Defendant objected to the State\u2019s reading of the victim impact statement,\nacknowledging that the victim has a right to put a statement into the record but requesting\nthat the trial court \u201cnot consider any hearsay that was contained in the statement as\nsubstantive evidence against [Defendant], things that, you know, the child victim might\nhave said, you know, to the mother, specifically.\u201d The court noted the victim impact\nstatement had not been subjected to cross-examination and stated it would \u201cgrant it the\nweight it\u2019s due, based on what [it\u2019s] heard.\u201d\n\n       Defendant\u2019s psychosexual evaluation was also admitted into evidence. Defendant\nnoted that he had \u201cassumed\u201d that the doctor who conducted the evaluation would testify\nbut acknowledged that the report was likely admissible even without the doctor\u2019s\ntestimony. However, \u201cto the extent that [he was] wrong about that and the statute doesn\u2019t\nspecifically allow that in,\u201d Defendant maintained his objection to the admission of the\npsychosexual evaluation without an opportunity to cross-examine the doctor.\n\n       The psychosexual evaluation included information regarding Defendant\u2019s current\nmental status, his family and interpersonal relationships, academic and criminal history,\nand psychiatric and substance abuse history. It also included questionnaires, objective\ntesting, and tools to determine Defendant\u2019s risk to reoffend. According to Defendant\u2019s\nversion of events, the victim \u201cwas the aggressor\u201d and was \u201cthrowing herself\u201d at him until\n\u201ceventually [Defendant] gave in.\u201d Defendant stated that the victim performed oral sex on\nhim, but he denied sexual intercourse. He \u201cdismissed the DNA evidence as [in]valid\u201d and\nasserted the victim and witness statements were incorrect and the victim\u2019s mother \u201cgot\neverybody to go against\u201d him. Ultimately, the evaluating doctor determined that\nDefendant\u2019s risk for engaging in sexual misconduct was \u201cwell above average[.]\u201d\n\n      Brandi Donaldson, Defendant\u2019s sister, testified that she had witnessed the victim\nconsume alcohol, smoke marijuana, and make sexual advances on grown men. Ms.\n                                              -5-\n\fDonaldson stated that Defendant is \u201ca really good person\u201d who had not been given the\nchance he needs and \u201cfalls victim to trying to fit in and do what other people want from\nhim.\u201d Defendant introduced five certificates of completion for behavioral and Bible classes\nhe had obtained while incarcerated.\n\n       The trial court stated that it had considered the evidence at the sentencing hearing,\nthe presentence report, the principles of sentencing and arguments on sentencing\nalternatives, the nature of the criminal conduct, evidence regarding mitigating and\nenhancement factors, statistical information from the administrative office of the courts on\nsentencing and Defendant\u2019s potential for rehabilitation and treatment. It found Defendant\nto be a Range I standard offender and noted that count one was a non-probateable offense\nrequired to be served at 100%. The trial court found that mitigating factor one, that the\ncriminal conduct neither caused nor threatened serious bodily injury, applied but did not\n\u201cput a whole lot of weight on it.\u201d See T.C.A. \u00a7 40-35-113(1).\n\n        Regarding enhancement factors, the trial court \u201cput a great deal of credit\u201d on\nDefendant\u2019s conviction for failure to appear and \u201cextensive, long-term\u201d drug use because\n\u201cthe best predictor of future performances is past behavior[.]\u201d See id. \u00a7 -114(1) (\u201cThe\ndefendant has a previous history of criminal convictions or criminal behavior, in addition\nto those necessary to establish the appropriate range[.]\u201d). It also applied enhancement\nfactor seven, that the crime was committed to gratify Defendant\u2019s desire for pleasure and\nexcitement. See id. \u00a7 -114(7). The court noted that Defendant was in a sexual relationship\nwith the victim\u2019s mother, \u201ca willing sex partner that\u2019s more your age[,]\u201d when he undertook\nthis sexual relationship with \u201cthis child\u201d and ejaculated during the sexual encounter. Based\non Defendant\u2019s two prior probation violations, the trial court found that Defendant had\nfailed to comply with the conditions of a sentence involving release into the community.\nSee id. \u00a7 -114(8). Finally, the trial court found that Defendant violated a position of private\ntrust because Defendant was \u201cinvolved in a parental role for this child\u201d and the victim\u2019s\nmother \u201ctrusted [Defendant] enough to have him in the house\u201d with her children. See id.\n\u00a7 -114(14).\n\n        The trial court sentenced Defendant to eleven years for count one and four years\neach for counts eight through thirteen. After considering the \u201caggravating circumstances,\u201d\nit found that partial consecutive sentencing was appropriate because Defendant was\nconvicted of more than two offenses involving sexual abuse of a minor. See id. \u00a7 40-35-\n115(a)(5). It ordered that counts nine and ten be served consecutively to count one, and\nthat eight, eleven, twelve, and thirteen run concurrently with each other but consecutively\nto counts one, nine, and ten, for an effective sentence of twenty-three years.\n\n       On March 21, 2022, the trial court entered a written order containing its oral\nfindings. Defendant filed a timely motion for new trial on April 20, 2022, which was\n                                             -6-\n\fsubsequently amended on May 8, 2023. The trial court denied Defendant\u2019s motion for new\ntrial via written order on April 4, 2024.1 Defendant\u2019s timely appeal is now before this\ncourt.\n\n                                               Analysis\n\n                                     I. Admission of Evidence\n\n        On appeal, Defendant argues that the psychosexual evaluation and the victim impact\nstatement were inadmissible hearsay, and their admission at the sentencing hearing violated\nhis rights under the confrontation clause because the authors of the documents did not\ntestify. The State argues that the trial court properly admitted the psychosexual evaluation\nand the victim impact statement. We agree with the State.\n\n        Both the United States and Tennessee constitutions provide criminal defendants the\nright to confront witnesses against them. U.S. Const. amend. VI; Tenn. Const. art. I, \u00a7 9.\n\u201cThe admission of testimonial hearsay at trial, without a showing of unavailability and an\nopportunity to cross-examine, generally violates a defendant\u2019s right to confront adverse\nwitnesses.\u201d State v.

Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 50 (2004)).\nHowever, this court has repeatedly held that \u201cthe Confrontation Clause is not applicable to\nsentencing hearings.\u201d State v. Bonds, 502 S.W.3d 118, 150 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2016) (first\nciting State v. Whited, No. E2013-02523-CCA-R3-CD, 2015 WL 2097843, at *10 (Tenn.\nCrim. App. May 4, 2015), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 506 S.W.3d 416 (Tenn. 2016); then\nciting State v. Boyd, No. W2009-00762-CCA-R3-CD, 2010 WL 1240720, at *8 (Tenn.\nCrim.

Watkins, 362 S.W.3d 530 (Tenn. 2012)). Thus, Defendant\u2019s argument that the\nvictim impact statement and the psychosexual evaluation violated his rights under the\nconfrontation clause are unavailing.\n\n        The Tennessee Rules of Evidence apply at sentencing except that reliable hearsay\n\u201cmay be admitted if the opposing party is accorded a fair opportunity to rebut any hearsay\nevidence so admitted[.]\u201d T.C.A. \u00a7 40-35-209(b). Examples of reliable hearsay include\ncertified copies of convictions or documents and presentence reports. State v. Richmond,\nNo. M2021-01025-CCA-R3-CD, 2022 WL 4372220, at *11 (Tenn. Crim. App. Sept. 22,\n2022) (citing State v. Baker, 956 S.W.2d 8, 17 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1997)), no perm. app.\n\n   1\n     The reasons for the approximate one-year delay between the original and amended motion for new trial\nand the trial court\u2019s entry of a written order denying the motion are unclear from the record. However,\nneither party raises the issue on appeal.\n                                                  -7-\n\ffiled; see Jenkins v. State, E2010-00938-CCA-R3-PC, 2011 WL 810770, at *5 (Tenn.\nCrim. App. Mar. 9, 2011) (concluding that the petitioner could not establish prejudice\nstemming from counsel\u2019s failure to object to admission of the presentence report because\n\u201cit is settled law that the presentence report is reliable hearsay and is admissible during\nsentencing hearings\u201d).\n\n       When a defendant is convicted of a sex offense, which includes aggravated statutory\nrape, and is eligible for an alternative sentence, a psychosexual evaluation \u201cshall be\nincluded as part of the presentence report and shall be considered by the court[.]\u201d T.C.A.\n\u00a7 39-13-705(b) (emphasis added). Additionally, \u201c[p]rior to imposition of sentence in a\nfelony case, the department of correction shall prepare a written victim impact statement\nas part of the presentence report on the defendant.\u201d Id. \u00a7 40-38-205. Thus, both the\npsychosexual evaluation and the victim impact statement were part of the presentence\nreport, and the \u201ctrial court is entitled to rely on the presentence report \u2018absent a showing\nthat the report is based upon unreliable sources or is otherwise inaccurate.\u2019\u201d State v.\nRogers, No. W2021-00807-CCA-R3-CD, 2022 WL 2733698, at *9 (Tenn. Crim. App. July\n14, 2022) (quoting State v. Crossman, No. 01C01-9311-CR-00394, 1994 WL 548712, at\n*6 (Tenn. Crim. App. Oct. 6, 1994)), no perm. app. filed. Because the psychosexual\nevaluation and victim impact statement are not constitutionally prohibited and are\nexplicitly authorized by statute, such evidence is admissible so long as it is reliable, and\nDefendant was provided the opportunity to rebut the evidence. See State v. Moss, 13\nS.W.3d 374, 385 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1999); T.C.A. \u00a7 40-35-209(b).\n\n       The victim impact statement was attached to the presentence report. It included\nboth the Tennessee Department of Correction (\u201cTDOC\u201d) Victim Impact Statement form,\nwhich was filled out, signed, and dated by the victim\u2019s mother and a typed statement from\nthe victim\u2019s mother on a separate page. See Harris, 2009 WL 1871919, at *6 (citing State\nv. Garner, No. M1999-01427-CCA-R3-CD, 2000 WL 1681022, at *3 (Tenn. Crim. App.\nNov. 9, 2000)) (stating that a victim impact statement\u2019s inclusion in the presentence report\noperated to verify the hearsay\u2019s reliability). While the typed statement does not include\nthe victim\u2019s mother\u2019s name or signature, it does include the style of the case and the\nvictim\u2019s mother indicated on the TDOC form to \u201csee attached.\u201d Additionally, the\nsubstance of the typed statement makes clear the victim\u2019s mother wrote the statement. To\nthe extent the written statement included details of the circumstances surrounding the\noffenses, such details explained the impact of Defendant\u2019s crimes on the victim and her\nfamily. We conclude that the victim impact statement was sufficiently reliable and, thus,\nwas properly admitted and considered by the trial court.\n\n       Regarding the psychosexual evaluation, Defendant has presented no evidence that\nthe psychosexual evaluation contained inaccuracies or was otherwise unreliable. We note\nthat Defendant asserts in his brief that \u201cthere is nothing in the record authenticating [the\n                                           -8-\n\fpsychosexual evaluation] as actually being the full, final, and complete document[.]\u201d\nHowever, Defendant did not raise this objection at sentencing or in his motion for new\ntrial. Thus, Defendant has waived any objection to the authenticity of the psychosexual\nevaluation. See Tenn. R. App. P. 36(a) (\u201cNothing in this rule shall be construed as requiring\nrelief be granted to a party responsible for an error or who failed to take whatever action\nwas reasonably available to prevent or nullify the harmful effect of an error.\u201d); State v.\nAvila-Salazar, No. M2023-01649-CCA-R3-CD, 2024 WL 3738647, at *2 (Tenn. Crim.\nApp. Aug. 9, 2024) (stating that a party cannot raise an issue for the first time or change\ntheir argument on appeal), perm. app. denied (Tenn. Jan. 24, 2025). The trial court did not\nerr in admitting and considering the psychosexual evaluation because the right to confront\nwitnesses does not extend to sentencing proceedings, and the trial court was required to\nconsider the psychosexual evaluation in sentencing Defendant for counts eight through\nthirteen.\n\n        Defendant is not entitled to relief on this basis.\n\n                                        II. Enhancement Factors\n\n        Defendant argues that the trial court erred by applying enhancement factors seven\nand fourteen because there was no evidence that the offenses were committed to satisfy\nDefendant\u2019s desire for pleasure and excitement other than the inherent sexual nature of\nDefendant\u2019s crimes or that he abused a position of private trust. 2 The State asserts that the\ntrial court properly applied these factors, and in the alternative, any error was harmless\nbecause the trial court imposed a within-range sentence after applying two unchallenged\nenhancement factors. We agree with the State.\n\n       On appeal, the party challenging the sentence bears the burden of establishing that\nthe sentence is improper. State v. Branham, 501 S.W.3d 577, 595 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2016).\nThis court reviews sentencing decisions under an \u201cabuse of discretion standard of review,\ngranting a presumption of reasonableness to within-range sentencing decisions that reflect\na proper application of the purposes and principles of our Sentencing Act.\u201d State v. Bise,\n380 S.W.3d 682, 707 (Tenn. 2012). \u201cA trial court abuses its discretion when it applies\nincorrect legal standards, reaches an illogical conclusion, bases its ruling on a clearly\nerroneous assessment of the proof, or applies reasoning that causes an injustice to the\ncomplaining party.\u201d State v. Phelps, 329 S.W.3d 436, 443 (Tenn. 2010) (citing State v.\nJordan, 325 S.W.3d 1, 38-40 (Tenn. 2010)).\n\n\n   2\n     In his brief, Defendant directs this court\u2019s attention to enhancement factors seven and fourteen but fails\nto include proper citation to the applicable statute or any case law in support of his position. While\nDefendant\u2019s omission has not frustrated this court\u2019s review, we reiterate the importance of including proper\nauthority in support of legal arguments. See Tenn. R. App. P. 27(a)(7)(a); Tenn. Ct. Crim. App. 10(b).\n                                                    -9-\n\f       Once a trial court determines the appropriate range of punishment, the trial court\nmust consider: (1) the evidence received at trial and the sentencing hearing; (2) the\npresentence report, including a validated risk and needs assessment; (3) any arguments as\nto sentencing alternatives; (4) the nature and characteristics of the criminal conduct; (5)\nany applicable mitigating and enhancement factors; (6) any statement the defendant makes\non his behalf; and (7) statistical information provided by the administrative office of the\ncourts as to sentencing practices for similar offenses in Tennessee. T.C.A. \u00a7 40-35-210(a),\n(b). Additionally, the sentence imposed should be \u201cno greater than that deserved for the\noffense committed\u201d and \u201cthe least severe measure necessary to achieve the purposes for\nwhich the sentence was imposed.\u201d Id. at \u00a7 40-35-103(2), (4).\n\n       When adjusting the length of a sentence within the appropriate range, a trial court\nis guided by, but not bound by, any applicable mitigating and enhancement factors. State\nv. Mosley, No. W2022-01424-CCA-R3-CD, 2024 WL 1406156, at *21 (Tenn. Crim. App.\nApr. 2, 2024) (quoting Bise, 380 S.W.3d at 706), perm. app. denied (Tenn. July 17, 2024).\nIt is within the trial court\u2019s sound discretion to weigh any applicable mitigating or\nenhancement factors. State v. Nelson, No. M2023-00176-CCA-R3-CD, 2024 WL\n1192985, at *15 (Tenn. Crim. App. Mar. 20, 2024) (quoting State v. Carter, 254 S.W.3d\n335, 345 (Tenn. 2007)), no perm. app. filed. Thus, \u201ca trial court\u2019s misapplication of an\nenhancement or mitigating factor does not invalidate the sentence imposed unless the trial\ncourt wholly departed\u201d from the sentencing act. Bise, 380 S.W.3d at 706.\n\n        Here, the trial court found that Defendant was a Range I, standard offender. See\nT.C.A. \u00a7 40-35-105. The trial court imposed within-range sentences for each conviction.\nSee id. \u00a7 -112(a)(2), (a)(4) (mandating that a Range I sentence be between eight and twelve\nyears for a Class B felony and between two and four years for a Class D felony).\nAdditionally, the trial court imposed partial consecutive sentencing. See id. \u00a7 -115(a)(5).\nDefendant does not challenge the manner or alignment of his sentences, and thus, this court\nwill focus solely on his challenge to the trial court\u2019s application of enhancement factors\nseven and fourteen.\n\n        Defendant asserts that, in applying enhancement factor seven, the trial court\nimproperly relied on the sexual nature of the offenses. Under Tennessee Code Annotated\nsection 40-35-114(7), a trial court may enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence within the\nappropriate range if it finds that the \u201coffense involved a victim and was committed to\ngratify the defendant\u2019s desire for pleasure or excitement[.]\u201d This factor may not be applied\nto sexual offenses that require proof of motive, such as sexual battery, but may be applied\nto sexual offenses that require no proof of motive, such as rape. State v. Kissinger, 922\nS.W.2d 482, 489-90 (Tenn. 1996) (noting that sexual battery requires proof that the\ndefendant made sexual contact, which is defined as intentional touching \u201cfor the purpose\nof sexual arousal or gratification\u201d). Neither especially aggravated sexual exploitation nor\n                                           - 10 -\n\faggravated statutory rape require proof of motive. See T.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 39-13-506(a), -17-\n1005(a), -17-1002(10).\n\n       \u201cEssential to proper application of this factor is the determination of the defendant\u2019s\nmotive for committing the offense.\u201d State v. Osborne, 251 S.W.3d 1, 26 (Tenn. Crim. App.\n2007) (citing State v. Arnett, 49 S.W.3d 250, 261 (Tenn. 2001)). The State must provide\n\u201cobjective evidence of the defendant\u2019s motivation to seek pleasure or excitement\u201d which\nmay include evidence of \u201csexually explicit remarks and overt sexual displays made by the\ndefendant, such as fondling or kissing a victim or otherwise behaving in a sexual\nmanner[.]\u201d State v. Tice, No. M2021-00495-CCA-R3-CD, 2022 WL 2800876, at *52\n(Tenn. Crim. App. July 18, 2022) (quoting Arnett, 49 S.W.3d at 262), perm. app. denied\n(Tenn. Dec. 14, 2022). The fact that the defendant orgasmed is insufficient, without more,\nto prove the existence of this factor. Kissinger, 922 S.W.2d at 491. \u201cThus, while this factor\ncan apply in a sexual offense, it must be shown that the circumstances surrounding the\noffense go beyond that which one would normally associate with sexual acts.\u201d State v.\nAllen, No. M2005-02808-CCA-R3-CD, 2006 WL 2380613, at *4 (Tenn. Crim. App. Aug.\n16, 2006).\n\n        Here, the trial court applied enhancement factor seven, finding that Defendant\nejaculated during the events and was in a relationship with the victim\u2019s mother. It\nexpressed confusion as to why Defendant entered a sexual relationship with the victim\ndespite having a consensual sexual relationship with the victim\u2019s mother. Further, the trial\ncourt considered the presentence report which established that the victim had told her sister\nthat she and Defendant had sex \u201ctoo many times to count,\u201d Defendant would \u201ctouch her\nbody all over before they had sex (breasts, legs, vagina),\u201d and Defendant told the victim he\nloved her and wanted to marry and have children with her. The victim also reported that\nafter she and Defendant had sex, he would insert his finger into her vagina. See State v.\nYelton, No. E2018-01436-CCA-R3-CD, 2019 WL 2475171, at *8 (Tenn. Crim. App. June\n13, 2019) (affirming application of enhancement factor seven because the \u201cevidence\npresented at trial and in the presentence report established that the [d]efendant kissed the\nvictim, fondled her breasts and buttocks, and inserted his finger into her vagina\u201d). The\nvictim\u2019s fifteen-year-old sister described when Defendant and the victim \u201cwere making a\nbet\u201d about whether the victim\u2019s sister would sleep with Defendant, a separate incident\nwhen Defendant sexually assaulted the victim\u2019s sister, and another incident when\nDefendant again propositioned the victim\u2019s minor sister, all of which support a finding that\nDefendant sought sexual interactions from the young girls to satisfy his desire for pleasure\nand excitement. The evidence supports the trial court\u2019s application of enhancement factor\nseven.\n\n       Next, Defendant contends that the trial court erred by applying enhancement factor\nfourteen. He notes that the State ultimately dismissed counts two through seven, and thus,\n                                            - 11 -\n\fDefendant \u201cdid not admit, even through virtue of his guilty plea, that he abused a position\nof public or private trust.\u201d Under Tennessee Code Annotated section 40-35-114(14), a trial\ncourt may enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence if the defendant abused a position of private trust\nin the commission of the offense. \u201c[A]pplication of the factor requires a finding, first, that\ndefendant occupied a position of trust\u201d and then a determination of \u201cwhether the position\noccupied was abused by the commission of the offense.\u201d Kissinger, 922 S.W.2d at 488.\nThe position of private trust is dependent on the nature of the relationship, not on the\nformality, and our supreme court has noted that the positions of \u201cparent, step-parent,\nbabysitter, teacher, [and] coach\u201d are a few \u201cobvious examples.\u201d Id. An adult who lives\nwith a minor \u201coccupies a position of \u2018presumptive private trust\u2019 with respect to the minor.\u201d\nState v. Gutierrez, 5 S.W.3d 641, 645 (Tenn. 1999).\n\n       Here, the trial court found that Defendant abused a position of private trust because\nDefendant told law enforcement that he occupied a \u201cparental role\u201d for the victim. The trial\ncourt further noted that Defendant lived in the home with the victim, dated and engaged in\na sexual relationship with the victim\u2019s mother, and the victim\u2019s mother \u201ctrusted him to\nleave the [victim] alone with him.\u201d These findings are more than adequately supported by\nthe record, particularly the presentence report which noted that Defendant stated that the\nvictim \u201clooked up to him,\u201d as well as the victim\u2019s sister\u2019s statement about the length of\ntime the family had known Defendant. See Kissinger, 922 S.W.2d at 489 (finding that the\ndefendant occupied a position of private trust because he had a long friendship with the\nvictims\u2019 mother and the victims\u2019 mother trusted him with the care of the boys); State v.\nChaves-Abrego, No. M2019-01686-CCA-R3-CD, 2021 WL 50252, at *9 (Tenn. Crim.\nApp. Jan. 6, 2021) (upholding trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant \u201cwas in a position of\nprivate trust with the victims\u2019 parents and that he abused that position of private trust\u201d\nwithout regard to whether the defendant was in a position of private trust with the minor\nvictims). The evidence supports the trial court\u2019s application of enhancement factor\nfourteen.\n\n        Finally, we note that even had we determined that the trial court erred in the\napplication of either or both enhancement factors discussed above, the trial court applied\ntwo other enhancement factors Defendant does not challenge. See State v. Ambrose, No.\nM2023-00097-CCA-R3-CD, 2024 WL 3596231, at *10 (Tenn. Crim. App. July 31, 2024)\n(citing State v. Dotson, 450 S.W.3d 1, 103 (Tenn. 2014)) (noting that \u201cthe application of a\nsingle enhancement factor supports an enhanced sentence\u201d), perm. app. denied (Tenn.

City of Portland, 306 Or 444, 448,\n760 P2d 252 (1988); Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers, 287 Or at\n602-03. In Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers, the court described\ncharacteristics that identify an adjudicative action:\n      \u201cGenerally, to characterize a process as an adjudication pre-\n      supposes that the process is bound to result in a decision and\n      that the decision is bound to apply preexisting criteria to con-\n      crete facts. * * * [A] further consideration has been whether\n      the action, even when the governing criteria leave much room\n      for policy discretion, is directed at a closely circumscribed\n      factual situation or a relatively small number of persons.\u201d\nId.\n        Our caselaw has come to recognize Strawberry Hill\n4 Wheelers as identifying three considerations that bear on\nthe determination whether a local government\u2019s process is\nadjudicative and therefore subject to a writ of review:\n     \u2022   Does the process, once begun, call for reaching a deci-\n         sion confined by preexisting criteria rather than by a\n         wide discretionary choice of action or inaction?\n     \u2022   To what extent is the decision-maker bound to apply\n         preexisting criteria to concrete facts?\n     \u2022   To what extent is the decision directed at a closely cir-\n         cumscribed factual situation or a relatively small num-\n         ber of persons?\nDodds, 222 Or App at 133 (noting that, in Strawberry Hill 4\nWheelers, \u201cthe Supreme Court explained that quasi-judicial\n\fCite as 339 Or App 27 (2025)                                                   31\n\ndecisions subject to writ of review are those processes that\nmeet three criteria\u201d); see also Hood River Valley v.

The\nthree considerations do not describe fixed elements of a quasi-\njudicial function but \u201ccharacteristics that might indicate that\na disputed action or decision-making process was judicial or\nquasi-judicial, as opposed to ministerial or legislative.\u201d Lane,\n310 Or App at 303-04 (quoting Hicks v. Central Point Sch. Dist.,\n270 Or App 532, 544, 348 P3d 307, rev den, 357 Or 743 (2015)).\nIf the writ-of-review process is available, the writ-of-review\nstatutes bar claims for declaratory or injunctive relief. ORS\n34.102 (stating that, if a writ of review is available, then the\ndecision must be reviewed under ORS 34.010 to ORS 34.102).\n         The determination whether the writ of review\nprocess was available here depends on whether the city\u2019s\naction was adjudicative, within the meaning of the term as\ndescribed in Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers. We therefore con-\nsider in more detail the largely undisputed facts giving rise\nto the current dispute.\n          It is undisputed that plaintiffs requested a permit\nfor the remodel of the ground-level commercial space of 1448\n28th Avenue. The materials submitted by plaintiffs did not\nrefer to a driveway and, on the submitted drawings, the area\nwhere the driveway curb cut sits was labeled \u201cwood fence.\u201d\n         The record shows that the city\u2019s actions consisted\nof the following: As required by Title 17 of the Portland\nCity Code (PCC), plaintiffs\u2019 application was reviewed by the\nPortland Bureau of Development Services (BDS) and Bureau\nof Transportation (PBOT). The review revealed a driveway\nand curb cut on plaintiffs\u2019 site and adjacent to the side of\nplaintiffs\u2019 building that did not comply with the PCC.1 In\n   1\n     PCC 17.28.110 provides, as relevant:\n       \u201cA. Purpose. Ensure that driveway locations promote the safe and\n   orderly flow of pedestrians, bicycles, and vehicular traffic, preserve on-street\n   parking, preserve or establish street trees, maximize opportunities for veg-\n   etated stormwater management, reduce conflicts with pedestrians and bicy-\n   cles and enhance the pedestrian environment.\n       \u201c* * * * *\n       \u201cC. Driveway definition: For the purposes of this Code section, a drive-\n   way is a gravel or paved way for vehicular traffic extending from the roadway\n\f32                      1448 28th Avenue, LLC v. City of Portland\n\nparticular, the driveway was closer than 25 feet from the\nintersection of NE 28th Avenue and NE Halsey Avenue.\nIt did not permit vehicles to exit in a forward motion, as\nrequired by the PCC for NE 28th Avenue, a \u201ccollector\u201d street.\nIn addition, the driveway was \u201ctoo narrow for modern vehic-\nular circulation under Portland City Code Requirements,\u201d\nhad a \u201cblind corner nearby,\u201d and was adjacent to \u201can inter-\nsection that has known safety problems\u201d and a \u201chistory of\ntraffic crashes going back many years.\u201d In fact, the driveway\ndid not meet the PCC definition of a \u201cdriveway,\u201d because it\ndid not access parking. Indeed, plaintiffs\u2019 application did not\neven identify the driveway; the curb cut area was labeled as\na \u201cwood fence.\u201d\n          Because plaintiffs\u2019 driveway was in violation of the\nPCC, plaintiffs\u2019 building-permit application triggered the\ncity to require either the removal or modification of the drive-\nway. Plaintiffs could have challenged the city\u2019s determina-\ntion through a driveway-design exception but they chose not\nto do so. And plaintiffs were not interested in attempting\nto modify the driveway. Instead, plaintiffs agreed to add a\ncurb to close the driveway. They completed an application\nfor a \u201cminor improvement permit,\u201d which allows them to add\na curb, so that the permitting process could continue. With\nthe addition of a curb as a condition, the city approved a per-\nmit for the remodel.\n        Several months later, plaintiffs sought a final occu-\npancy permit. But plaintiffs had not constructed the curb to\n     to the adjacent property line(s) for the purpose of providing access to parking\n     as provided under PCC Chapter 33.266.\n         \u201cD. Reconstruction and Revocation of Existing Driveways.\n         \u201c1. The Director of the Bureau of Transportation may revoke any drive-\n     way permit or require the modification of any driveway if:\n         \u201ca. The area occupied by the driveway is needed for right-of-way pur-\n     poses; or\n         \u201cb. Continued operation of the driveway interferes with the safe and\n     orderly flow of pedestrians, bicycles or vehicular traffic; or\n         \u201cc. The abutting owner has failed to comply with all specifications and\n     conditions of the permit; or\n         \u201cd. The driveway does not access a legal parking space on abutting prop-\n     erty per PCC Title 33.\n         \u201c2. The Council may revoke any driveway permit if it deems such action\n     will be in the public interest.\u201d\n\fCite as 339 Or App 27 (2025)                                      33\n\nclose the driveway, as permitted by the minor improvement\npermit. As a result, the city denied the request for a final\noccupancy permit, citing the permit\u2019s condition for removal\nof the driveway. In a letter to plaintiffs\u2019 legal counsel, the\ncity attorney explained:\n   \u201cThe applicant acquired a minor improvement permit to close\n   the driveway with this remodel work as a condition of PBOT\n   approving the building permit. This driveway closure con-\n   tinues to be required and final occupancy will not be issued\n   until such time as this driveway is permanently closed.\u201d\n         Plaintiffs objected, contending that the \u201chistoric res-\nidential driveway\u201d should not even have come into consider-\nation, because its use was only by the second-floor residential\nspace, which was not implicated by the remodeled ground-\nlevel commercial space. The city responded that it does not\nmatter which portion of the structure is being remodeled or\nwhether the space is commercial or residential\u2014the city\u2019s\nfocus for the driveway requirement is on the site, not the var-\nious uses of the site. And the city explained that, although\nthe city has authority under the PCC to require the removal\nor upgrade of any nonconforming driveway at any time (even\none that is \u201chistoric\u201d), its policy is to wait until a permit is\nsought for a development of the property before requiring an\nupgrade or removal of a nonconforming driveway.\n         Plaintiffs disagreed and chose to file this declar-\natory judgment action, which, as noted, the trial court\nrejected, concluding that it lacked jurisdiction. Plaintiffs\u2019\nprimary arguments under their single assignment of error\nare that the actions of the city on plaintiffs\u2019 permit were not\nquasi-judicial under the Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers criteria\nand, further, that the \u201chistoric residential driveway\u201d was\nnot implicated by the remodel of the commercial space.\n         The city responds that the city\u2019s decision to decline\nto issue the permanent occupancy permit until the driveway\nis removed falls within the quasi-judicial category described\nin Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers, and we agree.\n        We address each of the criteria.\n        Does the process, once begun, call for reaching a\ndecision confined by preexisting criteria rather than by a\n\f34                      1448 28th Avenue, LLC v. City of Portland\n\nwide discretionary choice of action or inaction? Plaintiffs\nrequested a final certificate of occupancy. The request would\neither be approved or denied and was thus bound to result in\na decision. And the city\u2019s decision to deny the request pend-\ning removal of the driveway was confined by preexisting cri-\nteria\u2014those rules set forth in the PCC relating to noncon-\nforming driveways and established city policy that upgrades\nto or removal of nonconforming driveways would be required\nupon application for development of a property.\n         To what extent is the decision-maker bound to apply\npreexisting criteria to concrete facts? The undisputed record\nshows that the city has fixed procedures and criteria that it\napplies in evaluating development permits and that, in mak-\ning the decision that plaintiffs were required to remove the\ndriveway before a final certificate of occupancy would be\nissued, the city applied those preexisting criteria, including\nthe rules set forth in the PCC. The undisputed record further\nshows that, in making the decision that the driveway must\nbe removed, the city made its determination based on undis-\nputed concrete facts.\n         To what extent is the decision directed at a closely\ncircumscribed factual situation or a relatively small number\nof persons? Plaintiffs concede that the city\u2019s decision was\ndirected at a closely circumscribed factual situation and a\nrelatively small number of persons.\n         The considerations identified by the Supreme Court\nin Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers each weigh in favor of a deter-\nmination that the city\u2019s action was \u201cadjudicative\u201d or quasi-\njudicial. The record further persuades us that the city\u2019s\naction falls within the adjudicative or quasi-judicial category\ndescribed in Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers and was therefore\nsubject to writ of review. For that reason, we conclude that\nthe trial court did not err in determining that it lacked juris-\ndiction to consider plaintiffs\u2019 declaratory judgment action.2\n           Affirmed.\n\n     2\n       Because we conclude that the trial court did not err in dismissing plaintiffs\u2019\ndeclaratory judgment claim for lack of jurisdiction, we need not address plain-\ntiffs\u2019 argument that the remodel of the commercial space did not implicate the\n\u201chistoric residential driveway.\u201d\n\f",

ORS\n34.102 (stating that, if a writ of review is available, then the\ndecision must be reviewed under ORS 34.010 to ORS 34.102).\n         The determination whether the writ of review\nprocess was available here depends on whether the city\u2019s\naction was adjudicative, within the meaning of the term as\ndescribed in Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers. We therefore con-\nsider in more detail the largely undisputed facts giving rise\nto the current dispute.\n          It is undisputed that plaintiffs requested a permit\nfor the remodel of the ground-level commercial space of 1448\n28th Avenue. The materials submitted by plaintiffs did not\nrefer to a driveway and, on the submitted drawings, the area\nwhere the driveway curb cut sits was labeled \u201cwood fence.\u201d\n         The record shows that the city\u2019s actions consisted\nof the following: As required by Title 17 of the Portland\nCity Code (PCC), plaintiffs\u2019 application was reviewed by the\nPortland Bureau of Development Services (BDS) and Bureau\nof Transportation (PBOT). The review revealed a driveway\nand curb cut on plaintiffs\u2019 site and adjacent to the side of\nplaintiffs\u2019 building that did not comply with the PCC.1 In\n   1\n     PCC 17.28.110 provides, as relevant:\n       \u201cA. Purpose. Ensure that driveway locations promote the safe and\n   orderly flow of pedestrians, bicycles, and vehicular traffic, preserve on-street\n   parking, preserve or establish street trees, maximize opportunities for veg-\n   etated stormwater management, reduce conflicts with pedestrians and bicy-\n   cles and enhance the pedestrian environment.\n       \u201c* * * * *\n       \u201cC. Driveway definition: For the purposes of this Code section, a drive-\n   way is a gravel or paved way for vehicular traffic extending from the roadway\n\f32                      1448 28th Avenue, LLC v. City of Portland\n\nparticular, the driveway was closer than 25 feet from the\nintersection of NE 28th Avenue and NE Halsey Avenue.\nIt did not permit vehicles to exit in a forward motion, as\nrequired by the PCC for NE 28th Avenue, a \u201ccollector\u201d street.\nIn addition, the driveway was \u201ctoo narrow for modern vehic-\nular circulation under Portland City Code Requirements,\u201d\nhad a \u201cblind corner nearby,\u201d and was adjacent to \u201can inter-\nsection that has known safety problems\u201d and a \u201chistory of\ntraffic crashes going back many years.\u201d In fact, the driveway\ndid not meet the PCC definition of a \u201cdriveway,\u201d because it\ndid not access parking. Indeed, plaintiffs\u2019 application did not\neven identify the driveway; the curb cut area was labeled as\na \u201cwood fence.\u201d\n          Because plaintiffs\u2019 driveway was in violation of the\nPCC, plaintiffs\u2019 building-permit application triggered the\ncity to require either the removal or modification of the drive-\nway. Plaintiffs could have challenged the city\u2019s determina-\ntion through a driveway-design exception but they chose not\nto do so. And plaintiffs were not interested in attempting\nto modify the driveway. Instead, plaintiffs agreed to add a\ncurb to close the driveway. They completed an application\nfor a \u201cminor improvement permit,\u201d which allows them to add\na curb, so that the permitting process could continue. With\nthe addition of a curb as a condition, the city approved a per-\nmit for the remodel.\n        Several months later, plaintiffs sought a final occu-\npancy permit. But plaintiffs had not constructed the curb to\n     to the adjacent property line(s) for the purpose of providing access to parking\n     as provided under PCC Chapter 33.266.\n         \u201cD.

The area occupied by the driveway is needed for right-of-way pur-\n     poses; or\n         \u201cb. Continued operation of the driveway interferes with the safe and\n     orderly flow of pedestrians, bicycles or vehicular traffic; or\n         \u201cc.

As a result, the city denied the request for a final\noccupancy permit, citing the permit\u2019s condition for removal\nof the driveway. In a letter to plaintiffs\u2019 legal counsel, the\ncity attorney explained:\n   \u201cThe applicant acquired a minor improvement permit to close\n   the driveway with this remodel work as a condition of PBOT\n   approving the building permit. This driveway closure con-\n   tinues to be required and final occupancy will not be issued\n   until such time as this driveway is permanently closed.\u201d\n         Plaintiffs objected, contending that the \u201chistoric res-\nidential driveway\u201d should not even have come into consider-\nation, because its use was only by the second-floor residential\nspace, which was not implicated by the remodeled ground-\nlevel commercial space. The city responded that it does not\nmatter which portion of the structure is being remodeled or\nwhether the space is commercial or residential\u2014the city\u2019s\nfocus for the driveway requirement is on the site, not the var-\nious uses of the site. And the city explained that, although\nthe city has authority under the PCC to require the removal\nor upgrade of any nonconforming driveway at any time (even\none that is \u201chistoric\u201d), its policy is to wait until a permit is\nsought for a development of the property before requiring an\nupgrade or removal of a nonconforming driveway.\n         Plaintiffs disagreed and chose to file this declar-\natory judgment action, which, as noted, the trial court\nrejected, concluding that it lacked jurisdiction. Plaintiffs\u2019\nprimary arguments under their single assignment of error\nare that the actions of the city on plaintiffs\u2019 permit were not\nquasi-judicial under the Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers criteria\nand, further, that the \u201chistoric residential driveway\u201d was\nnot implicated by the remodel of the commercial space.\n         The city responds that the city\u2019s decision to decline\nto issue the permanent occupancy permit until the driveway\nis removed falls within the quasi-judicial category described\nin Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers, and we agree.\n        We address each of the criteria.\n        Does the process, once begun, call for reaching a\ndecision confined by preexisting criteria rather than by a\n\f34                      1448 28th Avenue, LLC v. City of Portland\n\nwide discretionary choice of action or inaction? Plaintiffs\nrequested a final certificate of occupancy. The request would\neither be approved or denied and was thus bound to result in\na decision. And the city\u2019s decision to deny the request pend-\ning removal of the driveway was confined by preexisting cri-\nteria\u2014those rules set forth in the PCC relating to noncon-\nforming driveways and established city policy that upgrades\nto or removal of nonconforming driveways would be required\nupon application for development of a property.\n         To what extent is the decision-maker bound to apply\npreexisting criteria to concrete facts? The undisputed record\nshows that the city has fixed procedures and criteria that it\napplies in evaluating development permits and that, in mak-\ning the decision that plaintiffs were required to remove the\ndriveway before a final certificate of occupancy would be\nissued, the city applied those preexisting criteria, including\nthe rules set forth in the PCC. The undisputed record further\nshows that, in making the decision that the driveway must\nbe removed, the city made its determination based on undis-\nputed concrete facts.\n         To what extent is the decision directed at a closely\ncircumscribed factual situation or a relatively small number\nof persons? Plaintiffs concede that the city\u2019s decision was\ndirected at a closely circumscribed factual situation and a\nrelatively small number of persons.\n         The considerations identified by the Supreme Court\nin Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers each weigh in favor of a deter-\nmination that the city\u2019s action was \u201cadjudicative\u201d or quasi-\njudicial. The record further persuades us that the city\u2019s\naction falls within the adjudicative or quasi-judicial category\ndescribed in Strawberry Hill 4 Wheelers and was therefore\nsubject to writ of review. For that reason, we conclude that\nthe trial court did not err in determining that it lacked juris-\ndiction to consider plaintiffs\u2019 declaratory judgment action.2\n           Affirmed.\n\n     2\n       Because we conclude that the trial court did not err in dismissing plaintiffs\u2019\ndeclaratory judgment claim for lack of jurisdiction, we need not address plain-\ntiffs\u2019 argument that the remodel of the commercial space did not implicate the\n\u201chistoric residential driveway.\u201d\n\f</pre>",

On the first day of trial, plaintiff,\nappearing pro se, informed the court that he intended to\npursue only the unpaid wages claim and wanted to drop the\nother claims. Trial was held on the unpaid wages claim, and\nthe court sitting as factfinder found in defendant\u2019s favor. All\nclaims were then dismissed with prejudice. Defendant filed\nan attorney fee statement, summarily asserting a right to\nfees and costs under \u201cORS 659A.885(8)(e), ORS 652.200, and\nORS 20.107.\u201d1 Plaintiff made no objection to the fee state-\nment. As part of its general judgment, the court awarded\n$37,343.08 in attorney fees and costs to defendant, which\nwas the full amount requested. The court did not identify\nthe statutory bases for the fee award, nor did it make any\nfindings.\n         On appeal, plaintiff raises three assignments of\nerror, all relating to the fee award. In his first assignment\nof error, plaintiff argues that the court erred in awarding\nfees on the wage claim. He assumes that the court did not\naward fees under the statute cited in the fee statement, ORS\n652.200, because it applies only to prevailing plaintiffs, and\ninstead awarded fees under ORS 20.105\u2014a statute never\nmentioned in the trial court but that provides for a fee award\nin a civil action if there \u201cwas no objectively reasonable basis\nfor asserting the claim\u201d\u2014and argues why it was error to do\nso. In response, defendant argues that it could have been\nawarded fees under ORS 653.055(4), another statute never\nmentioned below. In his second and third assignments of\nerror, plaintiff argues that the court\u2019s findings are inade-\nquate for meaningful appellate review.\n         It is true that the trial court\u2019s findings are inade-\nquate for meaningful appellate review. See Northwest Pump\n& Equipment Co. v. Stach, 167 Or App 64, 69, 1 P3d 466\n(2000) (\u201cWhile Oregon courts have broad discretion in setting\n    1\n      ORS 20.107 and ORS 659A.885(8)(e) pertain to discrimination claims. ORS\n652.200 pertains to claims for unpaid wages upon termination.\n\f224              Abualya v.

It is also true that the\nfee award on the wage claim is potentially problematic, inso-\nfar as the only statute cited as a basis for awarding fees on\nthat claim was a statute that, on its face, did not apply. See\nORS 652.200(1) (requiring fee award if the court \u201center[s]\njudgment for the plaintiff\u201d).\n          Ultimately, however, plaintiff\u2019s failure to object to\nthe fee statement in the trial court proceeding is dispositive.\nORCP 68 C(4)(f) provides, with respect to attorney fee state-\nments, that \u201c[i]f objections are not timely filed, the court may\naward attorney fees or costs and disbursements sought in\nthe statement.\u201d We have previously recognized the discre-\ntionary nature of \u201cmay\u201d and that the trial court may choose\nto independently assess the fee statement even absent objec-\ntions. Moreau v. Samalin, 295 Or App 534, 538, 435 P3d\n794 (2019) (\u201cEven when a fee petition is unopposed, the trial\ncourt may make its own assessment of the reasonableness of\nthe fees. See ORCP 68 C(4)(f); Council on Court Procedures,\nStaff Comment to ORCP 68, 32 (Dec 15, 1990) (the trial court\nhas \u2018discretion to pass on the reasonableness of the amounts\nclaimed,\u2019 even when there is no objection).\u201d). Plaintiff has\nnot developed any argument as to how, given ORCP 68 C(4)\n(f), it was an abuse of discretion to award fees and costs as\nrequested when no objection was filed, or why the court was\nrequired to make any findings under the circumstances. See\nMcCarthy v. Oregon Freeze Dry, Inc., 327 Or 185, 187 & n 2,\n957 P2d 1200 (1998) (explaining that \u201cthe objections of a\nparty who resists a petition for attorney fees play an import-\nant role in framing any issues that are relevant to the court\u2019s\ndecision to award or deny attorney fees\u201d and that \u201c[n]o party\nwill be heard to complain of the absence of a finding by the\ncourt on an issue that the party did not raise\u201d).\n        We therefore reject all three assignments of error,\nbased on the lack of any objection in the trial court, which\nallowed the court the option of simply awarding the full\namount requested without conducting an independent\nanalysis.\n        Affirmed.\n\f",

In his only counseled assignment of error,\npetitioner argues that the post-conviction court erred in\ndenying relief on his claim that trial counsel provided inad-\nequate and ineffective assistance by failing to advise him\nin late 2018, before he accepted a plea deal, that his con-\nduct did not constitute the crime of delivery of a controlled\nsubstance. In two pro se supplemental assignments of error,\npetitioner argues that the court also erred because trial\ncounsel provided inadequate and ineffective assistance by\nfailing to request a continuance at sentencing and because\nthe trial court made a comment during sentencing that was\nprejudicial to petitioner. We reject the pro se supplemental\nassignments of error without written discussion, for both\nprocedural and substantive reasons. As for the counseled\nassignment of error, we affirm for the reasons described\nbelow.\n         In October 2018, petitioner was arrested during a\ntraffic stop. The police searched petitioner\u2019s vehicle after\nthe arrest and found 30 grams of methamphetamine, 88.5\ngrams of heroin, a scale, a handgun, and two notebooks\nappearing to contain drug records. Petitioner was charged\nwith delivery of heroin, delivery of methamphetamine, felon\nin possession of a firearm, second-degree criminal posses-\nsion of a forged instrument, resisting arrest, identity theft,\nand first-degree theft. Two months later, pursuant to a plea\nagreement, he pleaded guilty to delivery of heroin, felon in\npossession of a firearm, and resisting arrest, and the remain-\ning charges were dismissed. After an unsuccessful direct\nappeal, petitioner sought post-conviction relief. He alleged,\namong other things, that trial counsel had provided inad-\nequate and ineffective assistance by failing to advise him\nthat his conduct did not constitute the crime of delivery of a\ncontrolled substance\u2014a claim that rested on the overruling\nof State v. Boyd, 92 Or App 51, 756 P2d 1276, rev den, 307 Or\n77 (1988), by State v. Hubbell, 314 Or App 844, 500 P3d 728\n(2021), aff\u2019d, 371 Or 340, 537 P3d 503 (2023), nearly three\nyears after petitioner pleaded guilty. The post-conviction\ncourt denied relief, and petitioner now appeals.\n\f84                                            Ayala v. Fhuere\n\n         A criminal defendant has the right to adequate and\neffective assistance of counsel under Article I, section 11, of\nthe Oregon Constitution and the Sixth Amendment to the\nUnited States Constitution. Antoine v. Taylor, 368 Or 760,\n767, 499 P3d 48 (2021). A violation of those rights entitles a\npetitioner to post-conviction relief. ORS 138.530(1)(a). Under\nthe Oregon Constitution, to succeed on a claim of inadequate\nassistance, petitioner must establish by a preponderance of\nthe evidence that \u201ccounsel failed to exercise reasonable pro-\nfessional skill and judgment, and that the petitioner suffered\nprejudice as a result.\u201d Johnson v. Premo, 361 Or 688, 699,\n399 P3d 431 (2017). \u201cA functionally equivalent two-element\nstandard governs petitioner\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance\nof counsel under the Sixth Amendment.\u201d Smith v. Kelly, 318\nOr App 567, 568-69, 508 P3d 77 (2022), rev den, 370 Or 822\n(2023).\n         In this case, the crux of petitioner\u2019s claim was that\nhis trial counsel was inadequate and ineffective for failing\nto foresee the change in the law that occurred when Hubbell\noverruled Boyd. He claims that his attorney should have\nforeseen that eventuality in 2018 and advised him accord-\ningly\u2014that is, advised him that, if he were convicted at trial\nof delivery of heroin or methamphetamine, those convictions\nmight be reversed on appeal if he challenged Boyd and we\nor the Supreme Court decided to overturn it, as ultimately\nhappened in Hubbell in 2021. We are unpersuaded.\n         In assessing a claim of inadequate assistance of\ncounsel, we \u201cmust make every effort to evaluate a lawyer\u2019s\nconduct from the lawyer\u2019s perspective at the time, without\nthe distorting effects of hindsight.\u201d Lichau v. Baldwin, 333\nOr 350, 360, 39 P3d 851 (2002). Absent some indication of\nan impending change in the law, defense counsel usually\ncannot be said to have provided inadequate or ineffective\nassistance by advising a defendant in accordance with then-\nexisting law, particularly when there is controlling prece-\ndent on the issue. Miller v. Lampert, 340 Or 1, 15-16, 125 P3d\n1260 (2006). Indeed, even when a legal issue is \u201cunsettled,\u201d\nan inadequate-assistance claim will prevail \u201conly if \u2018the\nstate of the law was so obviously ambiguous that any law-\nyer exercising reasonable professional skill and judgment\n\fCite as 339 Or App 82 (2025)                                85\n\nnecessarily would have seen it.\u2019 \u201d Curry v. Highberger, 326 Or\nApp 259, 264, 531 P3d 702, rev den, 371 Or 511 (2023) (quot-\ning Jackson v. Franke, 369 Or 422, 434, 507 P3d 222 (2022)).\n         In other words, it is not enough that, looking back,\n\u201ccounsel could have made a winning argument.\u201d Hagberg v.\nCoursey, 269 Or App 377, 382, 344 P3d 1118, rev den, 358 Or\n69 (2015). The petitioner must show that \u201cbased on the law\nas it existed at the time of [the petitioner\u2019s proceeding], any\nreasonably competent defense attorney would have made\nthe argument that was ultimately deemed meritorious in\n[a later case].\u201d Id.

New Jersey, 530\nUS 466, 120 S Ct 2348, 147 L Ed 2d 435 (2000), that sen-\ntence enhancement facts must be found by a jury. Similarly,\nin Kelly, 318 Or App at 569-70, we held that the petition-\ner\u2019s counsel did not perform deficiently, given existing law,\nwhere counsel did not foresee in 2015 that the United States\nSupreme Court would hold five years later in Ramos v.\nLouisiana, 590 US 83, 140 S Ct 1390, 206 L Ed 2d 583 (2020),\nthat nonunanimous guilty verdicts are unconstitutional.\n         Returning to the present case, Boyd was decided\nin 1988. It expressly held that a person could be convicted\nof the completed crime of delivery of a controlled substance\nbased on evidence that they possessed a large amount of a\ncontrolled substance with the intent to sell it. Boyd, 92 Or\nApp at 54-55 (so holding, based on our construction of ORS\n475.005(8), which defined \u201cdelivery\u201d to include \u201cattempted\ntransfer\u201d). That was the law for more than 30 years, until\n2021, when we overturned Boyd in Hubbell. Hubbell held that\npossession of a large amount of a controlled substance with\nthe intent to sell it could support a conviction for attempted\ndelivery, but that completed delivery required more. See\n\f86                                                         Ayala v.

In petitioner\u2019s view,\nhad counsel so advised him, he could and would have pro-\nceeded to trial, been convicted of the delivery counts, and\ngotten Boyd overturned on appeal in his own case, result-\ning in the reversal of those convictions (presumably to be\nreplaced with attempted delivery convictions).\n         We are unpersuaded that petitioner\u2019s counsel\u2019s\nreliance on Boyd while advising him in late 2018 reflects a\nfailure to exercise reasonable skill and judgment. Boyd had\nbeen controlling precedent for 30 years at that point, and its\ndemise was sudden. Indeed, even the defendant in Hubbell\ndid not foresee the change in the law\u2014we decided sua sponte\nto re-examine \u201cthe settled rule\u201d of Boyd in Hubbell and\nrequested supplemental briefing toward that end. Hubbell,\n314 Or App at 847; id. at 854 (explaining how we came to\ndecide to revisit Boyd). Controlling for the distorting effect\nof hindsight, we agree with the post-conviction court that\npetitioner\u2019s trial counsel did not fail to exercise reasonable\nprofessional skill and judgment by advising petitioner in a\nmanner consistent with then-existing law and without ref-\nerence to the possibility that Boyd could be overruled in the\nfuture. Accordingly, the post-conviction could did not err in\ndenying relief on the claim at issue.\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n    1\n      The legislature amended the delivery statutes in 2024 to effectively rein-\nstate the Boyd rule.

J.\n         Petitioner appeals the denial of his petition for post-\nconviction relief. In his only counseled assignment of error,\npetitioner argues that the post-conviction court erred in\ndenying relief on his claim that trial counsel provided inad-\nequate and ineffective assistance by failing to advise him\nin late 2018, before he accepted a plea deal, that his con-\nduct did not constitute the crime of delivery of a controlled\nsubstance. In two pro se supplemental assignments of error,\npetitioner argues that the court also erred because trial\ncounsel provided inadequate and ineffective assistance by\nfailing to request a continuance at sentencing and because\nthe trial court made a comment during sentencing that was\nprejudicial to petitioner. We reject the pro se supplemental\nassignments of error without written discussion, for both\nprocedural and substantive reasons. As for the counseled\nassignment of error, we affirm for the reasons described\nbelow.\n         In October 2018, petitioner was arrested during a\ntraffic stop. The police searched petitioner\u2019s vehicle after\nthe arrest and found 30 grams of methamphetamine, 88.5\ngrams of heroin, a scale, a handgun, and two notebooks\nappearing to contain drug records. Petitioner was charged\nwith delivery of heroin, delivery of methamphetamine, felon\nin possession of a firearm, second-degree criminal posses-\nsion of a forged instrument, resisting arrest, identity theft,\nand first-degree theft. Two months later, pursuant to a plea\nagreement, he pleaded guilty to delivery of heroin, felon in\npossession of a firearm, and resisting arrest, and the remain-\ning charges were dismissed. After an unsuccessful direct\nappeal, petitioner sought post-conviction relief. He alleged,\namong other things, that trial counsel had provided inad-\nequate and ineffective assistance by failing to advise him\nthat his conduct did not constitute the crime of delivery of a\ncontrolled substance\u2014a claim that rested on the overruling\nof State v.

State of Oregon\n\n         JACQUOT, J.\n          On appeal from a judgment denying post-conviction\nrelief, petitioner argues that the post-conviction court erred\nwhen it denied relief on his claims of ineffective assistance\nof trial and appellate counsel. Petitioner argues that trial\ncounsel was ineffective in failing to obtain additional police\nrecords regarding similar allegations made by the underage\nvictim against other people, and in failing to request a hear-\ning regarding the use of restraints on petitioner during his\nbench trial. Petitioner also argues that appellate counsel was\nineffective in not assigning error to the use of restraints or\nto the trial court compelling him to appear in prison clothing\nduring trial. We affirm.\n          We review the post-conviction court\u2019s denial of relief\nfor legal error. Green v. Franke, 357 Or 301, 312, 350 P3d 188\n(2015). We are bound by the post-conviction court\u2019s findings\nof historical fact if those findings are supported by the evi-\ndence in the record. Id. To succeed on a claim of inadequate\nassistance of counsel, a petitioner must show (1) that trial\ncounsel failed to exercise reasonable professional skill and\njudgment, and (2) that the petitioner suffered prejudice as\na result. Id. A petitioner may establish prejudice by demon-\nstrating that counsel\u2019s failure \u201ccould have tended to affect\u201d\nthe outcome of the proceedings, meaning more than \u201cmere\npossibility, but less than probability.\u201d Id. at 322-23.\n          In his first assignment of error, petitioner argues that\nthe post-conviction court erred when it denied his claim that\nhis trial counsel was inadequate in not obtaining additional\npolice records about prior similar allegations made by the\nvictim against others. The court denied relief, because coun-\nsel had presented evidence at trial that the victim had made\nprior allegations against others and \u201cvigorously argued these\npoints,\u201d including through an expert witness, and petitioner\ncould not show prejudice, because the records that petitioner\nalleged his trial counsel should have obtained did not contain\nany additional admissible information that was not presented\nat his trial.\n       Petitioner has not put forth any viable legal theory\nunder which the additional unobtained records could have\n\fNonprecedential Memo Op: 339 Or App 185 (2025)              187\n\nbeen admitted or used by trial counsel, nor has he shown\nthat the records contained anything that trial counsel had\nnot argued based upon the evidence that counsel did obtain.\nTherefore, petitioner has not shown that trial counsel\u2019s\nfailure to obtain the additional records could have tended\nto affect the outcome of the proceedings or that the post-\nconviction court erred in determining that trial counsel was\nnot ineffective in not obtaining additional police records.\n          In his second assignment of error, petitioner argues\nthat the post-conviction court erred when it denied his claim\nthat his trial counsel was inadequate in not objecting to the\ntrial court failing to make required findings on the record to\njustify the use of restraints. Upon trial counsel\u2019s request that\npetitioner not be restrained for trial, the trial court deferred\nto the jail\u2019s policy of keeping defendants in restraints during\nbench trials, and it assured petitioner and counsel that the\nrestraints would not impact its determinations in the case.\nThe deputy extended the restraint on petitioner\u2019s right hand\nso that he could write notes to his attorney during the pro-\nceedings. The court also would not allow petitioner to change\ninto civilian clothes.\n         A criminal defendant has the right to be free from\nphysical restraint during their trial, unless the court finds,\non the record, that there is evidence that the defendant poses\n\u201can immediate or serious risk of committing dangerous or\ndisruptive behavior, or * * * a serious risk of escape.\u201d State v.\nMcCright, 282 Or App 692, 700, 386 P3d 141 (2016). To show\nthat counsel was ineffective, a post-conviction petitioner\nmust prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that \u201ctrial\ncounsel\u2019s failure to object to the use of [restraints] without\nan adequate showing that petitioner posed a security risk\nhad a tendency to affect the result of his trial.\u201d Sproule v.\nCoursey, 276 Or App 417, 426, 367 P3d 946, rev den, 359 Or\n777 (2016) (internal quotation marks omitted). There are\nthree foundational types of prejudice that may result from\nerroneous restraint of a defendant during trial: \u201c(1) impinge-\nment on the presumption of innocence and the dignity of\njudicial proceedings; (2) inhibition of the accused\u2019s decision\nwhether to take the stand as a witness; and (3) inhibition of\nthe accused\u2019s consultation with his or her attorney.\u201d State v.\n\f188                           Chavez-Meza v. State of Oregon\n\nWall, 252 Or App 435, 442, 287 P3d 1250 (2012), rev den, 353\nOr 280 (2013). In addressing any potential prejudice from the\nuse of restraints, the question is whether there is a \u201cmaterial\nimpairment\u201d of those three interests. McCright, 282 Or App\nat 700. The concern for prejudice is less so in bench trials\nthan in jury trials, but it is nonetheless present. Id. at 701.\n         Here, the trial court erred because it did not make\nany findings regarding defendant\u2019s behavioral or escape risk,\ninstead relying solely on the jail\u2019s restraint policy. See id. at\n699-700 (trial court must make an independent determina-\ntion about the defendant\u2019s risk and cannot rely solely upon\nthe conclusions of others). However, that is not the issue in\nthis proceeding. The question before the post-conviction court\nwas whether trial counsel was ineffective in failing to request\na hearing or object to the trial court\u2019s failure to make the\nrequired findings, and whether petitioner suffered prejudice\nas a result. The post-conviction court denied relief for several\nreasons: Trial counsel did object to the use of restraints and\nwas repeatedly denied by the trial court; an accommodation\nwas made so that petitioner could take notes during the trial;\npetitioner was \u201cunable to show the use of restraints caused\nhim to appear guilty before the jury,\u201d because it was a bench\ntrial; the trial court repeatedly assured that the restraints\nwould not impact its determination; and petitioner did not\nshow that the restraints affected his ability to communicate\nwith his attorney or participate in the trial.\n        Petitioner has not provided any argument as to\nhow the post-conviction court\u2019s determination reflects legal\nerror. The court considered each of the types of prejudice\nand determined that petitioner did not meet his burden to\nshow that the erroneous restraint had a tendency to affect\nthe verdict, and its factual determinations are supported by\nevidence in the record. See State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Millican,\n138 Or App 142, 147-48, 906 P2d 857 (1995), rev den, 323\nOr 114 (1996) (finding harmless juvenile\u2019s shackling where\nthe juvenile court stated that the restraints \u201cwon\u2019t affect\nthe Court\u2019s view of the evidence here,\u201d and that, based upon\nthis court\u2019s independent review of the evidence, we did not\n\u201cbelieve that the trial court\u2019s credibility determinations\nwere impermissibly skewed\u201d).\n\fNonprecedential Memo Op: 339 Or App 185 (2025)            189\n\n         Regarding petitioner\u2019s argument that trial counsel\nwas ineffective in not preserving the issue of his errone-\nous restraint for appeal, as explained below, petitioner has\nnot shown that he would have succeeded on appeal even if\nthe argument had been preserved. Accordingly, the post-\nconviction court did not err in determining that trial coun-\nsel was not ineffective in failing to further object to the use\nof restraints.\n         Finally, in his third and fourth assignments of error,\npetitioner argues that appellate counsel was ineffective in\nfailing to assign error to the trial court\u2019s lack of findings\nto justify the restraints and to its decision that petitioner\ncould not wear his civilian clothes. To prevail on a claim of\nineffective assistance of appellate counsel, petitioner must\nestablish \u201c(1) that a competent appellate counsel would have\nasserted the claim, and (2) that had the claim of error been\nraised, it is more probable than not that the result would\nhave been different.\u201d Guinn v. Cupp, 304 Or 488, 496, 747\nP2d 984 (1987).\n          We have previously determined that, in a bench\ntrial, an error by the trial court in not making the required\nindividualized findings about a defendant\u2019s risk to justify\nrestraint is harmless, particularly when the trial court\nacknowledges that it will not allow the restraints to impact\nits decision. See, e.g., McCright, 282 Or App at 700; Millican,\n138 Or App at 147-48. Petitioner points to our comment in\nMcCright that when a trial is \u201cessentially, a credibility con-\ntest,\u201d erroneous restraint might not be harmless, as opposed\nto when there are no material factual disputes making \u201cthe\npotential for impermissible subconscious skewing\u201d of the\ntrial court\u2019s factual determinations \u201cnonexistent.\u201d 282 Or\nApp at 701 (internal quotation marks omitted). However, in\nthis posture, under the standard to prevail on a claim of\nineffective assistance of appellate counsel, petitioner must\nshow that it is \u201cmore probable than not\u201d that the claim\nwould have prevailed. Guinn, 304 Or at 496. Although a\ntrial with no factual disputes presents a \u201cnonexistent\u201d risk\nof impermissible subconscious skewing, that does not mean\nthat it is necessarily \u201cmore probable than not\u201d that any risk\ngreater than nonexistent would result in reversal on appeal.\n\f190                                 Chavez-Meza v. State of Oregon\n\nWe cannot say that the trial was solely a \u201ccredibility con-\ntest\u201d in the way that petitioner portrays, seeing as there was\nproof of communication between petitioner and the 12-year-\nold victim, and petitioner admitted to having sexual contact\nwith the victim.1 And, petitioner does not point to anything\nin the record to indicate that the trial court\u2019s credibility\ndeterminations were impermissibly skewed.\n          We do not imply here that, in a bench trial, the\npotential for unconscious bias against a restrained defen-\ndant does not exist, or that erroneous restraint will always\nbe harmless; nor do we downplay the affect that being held\nin restraints has on the presumption of innocence. See\nUnited States v. Sanchez-Gomez, 859 F3d 649, 661 (9th Cir\n2017), vac\u2019d on other grounds, 584 US 381, 138 S Ct 1532,\n200 L Ed 2d 792 (2018) (right against shackling absent indi-\nvidualized assessment of essential state interest applies in\nall proceedings, including bench trials, and \u201crespects our\nfoundational principle that defendants are innocent until\nproven guilty\u201d; courts \u201ccannot delegate this constitutional\nquestion to those who provide security\u201d); People v. Hamlett,\n193 NYS3d 658, 663, 80 Misc 3d 303, 307 (NY Crim Ct 2023)\n(\u201cIt cannot merely be assumed that judges are immune from\nthe prejudice and bias caused by visible shackles. We judges\nare human, and the sight of a defendant in restraints may\nunconsciously influence even a judicial factfinder.\u201d (Internal\nquotation marks omitted.)); People v. Williams, 2016 IL App\n(3d) 130901, \u00b6 30, 53 NE3d 1019, 1027 (2016) (\u201cAlthough the\npossibility of prejudicing the jury is a factor to be considered,\nthe reasons for forbidding shackling are not limited to trials\nby jury.\u201d). But in the posture and given the circumstances of\nthis case, we cannot say that it is more likely than not that\npetitioner would have prevailed on appeal.\n         Petitioner\u2019s argument that appellate counsel was\nineffective in failing to assign error to the trial court\u2019s denial\nof his request to appear in civilian clothing is also unavail-\ning. Petitioner provides no legal authority to show that,\neven had appellate counsel raised the issue on appeal, it\nwould have resulted in a reversal of petitioner\u2019s convictions.\n    1\n      Although petitioner later disputed the veracity of that confession, that\nissue was litigated through appeal unsuccessfully. State v. Chavez-Meza, 301 Or\nApp 373, 374 n 1, 456 P3d 322 (2019), rev den, 366 Or 493 (2020).\n\fNonprecedential Memo Op: 339 Or App 185 (2025)        191\n\nAccordingly, the post-conviction court did not err when it\ndetermined that appellate counsel was not ineffective.\n        Affirmed.\n\f",

Petitioner asserts that he is the biolog-\nical father of A and assigns error to the trial court\u2019s failure\nto determine paternity and to dismiss the guardianship. We\naffirm.\n         As the result of involvement with the Department\nof Human Services (DHS), and with A\u2019s mother\u2019s consent, A\u2019s\nmaternal grandmother became A\u2019s guardian in 2017. At that\ntime, petitioner was incarcerated. In 2022, A\u2019s mother moved\nto terminate the guardianship, a request she later withdrew.\nAfter A\u2019s mother made that motion, petitioner sought to inter-\nvene in the case, asserting that he was A\u2019s biological father. In\nsupport, petitioner alleged that he \u201ccontemporaneously filed\na Petition to Establish Custody, Parenting Time, and Child\nSupport in Jackson County Case No. 22DR20597, and expects\nto have paternity officially be established through that case.\u201d\nThe trial court granted petitioner\u2019s motion to intervene. At\npetitioner\u2019s request, the trial court ordered DNA testing for\nthe purpose of establishing paternity. Petitioner completed\nthe DNA test and filed the results with the court.\n        Petitioner next moved to dismiss the guardian-\nship proceeding, arguing that the result of the DNA testing\ndemonstrated that he was A\u2019s father:\n   \u201cPaternity has been established, and Intervenor is now\n   ready to assume custody of the child and provide for the\n   child\u2019s physical, mental, and emotional needs. It would be\n   in the best interests of the child for her to live with him,\n   and moreover Intervenor\u2019s rights as a parent necessarily\n   trump the interests of the Guardian/Grandparent.\u201d\nThe guardian opposed that request and asserted that pater-\nnity was not \u201cestablished\u201d because A\u2019s mother had been dat-\ning both petitioner and his \u201cbiologically similar\u201d brother at\nthe time A was conceived. Petitioner did not file a motion to\nestablish paternity, nor did he provide the court with the\nresults of the Jackson County case that he averred, in his\ninitial motion to intervene, would establish paternity.\n\f108                                                  Davis v. Deen\n\n       At the hearing on petitioner\u2019s motion to dismiss the\nguardianship, the trial court made several observations:\n       \u201cSo what I have in front of me now is a two-page\u2014it\u2019s a\n   one-and-a-half page motion to dismiss guardianship and a\n   one-page declaration with seven paragraphs, and there is\n   nothing\u2014there\u2019s a reference, the declaration by Mr. Davis\n   in paragraph 4, \u2018My paternity of [A] has been confirmed by\n   a court-ordered DNA test, the results of which are on file\n   with the court,\u2019 but that\u2014that is an evidentiary matter.\n      \u201c* * * * *\n       \u201cThe way Oregon evidence law requires hearings to be\n   conducted is there [are] exhibits and there is testimony, and\n   if there\u2019s an exhibit that is offered into evidence, the exhibit\n   needs to physically be offered, handed to the court clerk,\n   and it needs to be then determined whether or not it meets\n   the requirements of the law of evidence. If it does, the judge\n   is to rule that it\u2019s admitted into evidence. And there\u2019s also\n   testimony, and witnesses are sworn under oath, and they\n   testify, and that\u2019s what happens in judicial determinations.\n      \u201cAnd your motion is to dismiss a guardianship. It\u2019s not\n   a motion to adjudicate paternity that I see, so I\u2014I\u2019m not\n   quite sure procedurally what foundation exists.\u201d\nPetitioner\u2019s counsel responded that the court should take\njudicial notice of the result of the DNA testing that, according\nto petitioner, was already in the court record without other\nparties\u2019 objection. Petitioner further pointed to a statutory\nevidentiary presumption providing that a blood test that\nresults in a \u201ccumulative paternity index of 99 or greater\u201d cre-\nates a \u201cdisputable presumption of paternity.\u201d ORS 109.258. In\nresponse, guardian\u2019s counsel disputed petitioner\u2019s assertion\nthere was no objection to the blood test establishing paternity:\n   \u201cWe object to the paternity, and we don\u2019t think that a DNA\n   test alone in this circumstance is good enough, and we\u2019d be\n   happy to put evidence on if this was a hearing on paternity,\n   which it isn\u2019t.\u201d\nAfter hearing additional argument, the court ruled:\n       \u201cJudges are limited to making decisions based on what\n   is in front of the judge in a given case, in a given court\n   proceeding. What is in front of this court at this time is the\n   motion of [petitioner] to dismiss guardianship. * * *\n\fCite as 339 Or App 106 (2025)                                                109\n\n        \u201cThis court finds that a foundational requirement for\n    the court even to consider this matter is the establishment\n    of paternity. This court finds that paternity has not been\n    formally established. This court finds that a motion to\n    dismiss guardianship is not a proper procedural forum in\n    Coos County to pursue a determination of whether or not\n    there is paternity for [petitioner].\n        \u201cThat\u2019s particularly true because another proceeding is\n    now occurring in another circuit court in another county\n    in Oregon, specifically Jackson County, and under well-\n    established legal principles, where one proceeding is going\n    forward, a judge in another county can\u2019t simply jump in\n    and make determinations particularly where the motion to\n    determine paternity is not implicitly involved in a motion\n    to dismiss a guardianship.\u201d\nThe court denied the motion to dismiss, as well as petition-\ner\u2019s subsequent motion to reconsider. This appeal followed.\n         On appeal, petitioner argues that the trial court\nerred by not determining that petitioner established paternity\nof A and also erred in denying petitioner\u2019s motion to dismiss\nthe guardianship. In his first assignment of error, petitioner\nrenews the arguments he made below; that, pursuant to ORS\n109.258, the DNA test itself established paternity. Deferring\nto the trial court\u2019s factual findings that are supported by evi-\ndence in the record, we review the trial court\u2019s legal conclu-\nsions for legal error. Caswell v. Day Law and Associates, P. C.,\n309 Or App 367, 375, 481 P3d 972 (2021); Brown v. MacDonald\nand Associates, LLC, 260 Or App 275, 277, 317 P3d 301 (2013).1\n         The trial court did not err. As the trial court rec-\nognized, petitioner moved to terminate the guardianship,\nnot to establish paternity. Petitioner did not file a motion\nto establish, nor request an evidentiary hearing regarding,\npaternity. See, e.g., State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. L. V., 219 Or\nApp 207, 211, 182 P3d 866 (2008) (explaining that, after\nfather completed court-ordered genetic testing, \u201cDHS moved\nto establish [father\u2019s] legal paternity under ORS 419B.395\nand ORS 109.258\u201d). Rather, petitioner insisted that no such\nefforts were necessary despite the guardian\u2019s objections\n    1\n      Petitioner requests that we review the trial court\u2019s factual findings de novo\npursuant to ORS 19.415, however, the basis upon which we affirm the trial court\ndoes not involve any factual determinations.\n\f110                                                             Davis v. Deen\n\nto paternity. And, despite the court explaining the proper\npath for petitioner to proceed to present evidence regard-\ning paternity, petitioner insisted that no further steps were\nrequired.\n        As we understand petitioner\u2019s argument, he con-\ntends that ORS 109.2582 required that the trial court deter-\nmine, as a matter of law, that petitioner is A\u2019s father. ORS\n109.258, however, contains no such mandate.\n           ORS 109.258 \u201cprovides that, in a paternity adjudica-\ntion, \u2018[a] disputable presumption of paternity is created if one\nor more blood tests [including DNA tests] result in a cumu-\nlative paternity index of 99 or greater.\u2019 \u201d Sause and Schnitzer,\n371 Or 573, 594, 539 P3d 722 (2023) (emphasis added) (quot-\ning ORS 109.258). The statute is intended \u201cto help resolve evi-\ndentiary disputes over the efficacy of blood tests in identify-\ning putative fathers.\u201d Id. at 597. Accordingly, it does not itself\ncreate a proceeding to establish paternity; rather, it dictates\nhow a trial court must view blood tests in such a proceeding.\nSee id. at 598 (\u201cFor a blood test to lead to legal parentage, as\nORS 109.258 contemplates, there must be an adjudication or\nother proceeding.\u201d); see also ORS 109.124 to 109.230 (estab-\nlishing procedures for filiation proceedings, including who\nmay initiate, where proceedings must occur, and contents of\nhearing). To aid a trial court in making a paternity determi-\nnation in those proceedings, ORS 109.258 creates an eviden-\ntiary presumption \u201cthat may or may not lead to a determina-\ntion of legal parentage.\u201d Sause, 371 Or at 597.\n         Petitioner may be correct that, in certain proceed-\nings,3 he would be entitled to an evidentiary presumption of\n    2\n      ORS 109.258 provides:\n        \u201cA disputable presumption of paternity is created if one or more blood\n    tests result in a cumulative paternity index of 99 or greater. If the court\n    or administrator finds that the conclusions of all the experts, as disclosed\n    by the evidence based upon the tests, are that the alleged father is not the\n    father of the child, the question of paternity shall be resolved accordingly. If\n    the experts disagree in their findings or conclusions, the question shall be\n    submitted upon all the evidence.\u201d\n    3\n      We observe that the proceedings contemplated by the chapter containing\nthat evidentiary presumption do not include guardianship proceedings under\nORS chapter 125. ORS 109.252 (\u201cUnless the court or administrator finds good\ncause not to proceed in a proceeding under ORS 25.501 to 25.556, 109.124 to\n109.230 or 419B.609, in which parentage is a relevant fact, the court * * * upon\n\fCite as 339 Or App 106 (2025)                                                111\n\npaternity based on his blood test. A motion to terminate a\nguardianship, however, is not a proceeding to establish par-\nentage. In the absence of such a proceeding, an evidentiary\npresumption does not automatically establish paternity as a\nmatter of law.4\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\nmotion of any party to the action made at a time so as not to delay the proceedings\nunduly shall, order the mother, child, alleged father and any other named respon-\ndent who may be the father to submit to blood tests.\u201d).\n     4\n       Because we conclude that the trial court\u2019s determination that petitioner\nfailed to take the proper procedural steps to establish paternity was sufficient\nto support its decision, we do not address petitioner\u2019s second assignment of error,\nwhich challenges an alternate basis to support the same ruling. See Allianz\nGlobal Risks v. ACE Property & Casualty Ins. Co., 297 Or App 434, 439, 442 P3d\n212 (2019), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 367 Or 711 (2021) (recognizing that an affir-\nmance of a trial court\u2019s ruling on one basis obviates the need to reach arguments\nchallenging alternate bases supporting trial court\u2019s decision). Our disposition\nalso obviates the need to address petitioner\u2019s third assignment of error, which\nrelies on the premise that paternity was established to challenge the denial of the\nmotion to dismiss the guardianship.\n\f",

B. C. B.\n\n        JOYCE, J.\n         In this juvenile dependency case, father appeals\nfrom a judgment of the juvenile court that took jurisdiction\nover his three children. As we explain below, as to the alle-\ngation that jurisdiction was justified because father\u2019s mental\nhealth problems interfere with his ability to safely parent\nthe children, we agree that the evidence was insufficient to\nsupport that basis on which the juvenile court took jurisdic-\ntion. As to the other bases on which the juvenile court took\njurisdiction, having reviewed the record, we conclude that\nthe court did not err. Accordingly, we reverse and remand\nfor entry of a judgment omitting allegation 2(E) as a basis\nfor jurisdiction and otherwise affirm.\n         We review the sufficiency of the evidence support-\ning dependency jurisdiction by \u201cview[ing] the evidence, as\nsupplemented and buttressed by permissible derivative\ninferences, in the light most favorable to the trial court\u2019s\ndisposition and assess[ing] whether, when so viewed, the\nrecord was legally sufficient to permit that outcome.\u201d Dept.\nof Human Services v. N. P., 257 Or App 633, 639, 307 P3d 444\n(2013). \u201cTo establish a basis for juvenile court jurisdiction\nfor purposes of ORS 419B.100(1)(c), the state must prove, by\na preponderance of the evidence, ORS 419B.310(3), that a\nchild\u2019s welfare is endangered because, under the totality of\nthe circumstances, there is a current threat of serious loss\nor injury to the child that is reasonably likely to be real-\nized.\u201d Dept. of Human Services v. K. C. F., 282 Or App 12, 19,\n383 P3d 931 (2016) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n        The juvenile court took jurisdiction over the three\nchildren on several jurisdictional bases:\n  \u2022   Father has exposed the children to domestic violence\n      against mother;\n  \u2022   Father has physically abused the children and caused\n      them emotional distress;\n  \u2022   Father \u201chas mental health issues which impair his\n      judgment and ability to safely parent the children\u201d; and\n  \u2022   Two of the three children are fearful of returning to\n      father\u2019s care.\n\fNonprecedential Memo Op: 339 Or App 176 (2025)              179\n\n         On the record before us, we readily conclude that\nthe juvenile court correctly took jurisdiction on the first two\nbases, involving domestic violence and physical abuse. As\nto the allegation that two of the three children are afraid of\nreturning to father\u2019s care, father argues that there is no evi-\ndence that the two children\u2019s fear of father exposed the third\nchild\u2014who did not share that same fear\u2014to a risk of harm,\nsuch to support taking jurisdiction over the third child on\nthat basis. Whatever merit that argument may have, father\ndid not make that argument to the juvenile court; his argu-\nment is thus unpreserved, and we decline to address it. See\nDept. of Human Services v. C. M., 284 Or App 521, 530-31,\n392 P3d 820 (2017) (rejecting as unpreserved an argument\nthat the evidence was insufficient to support a jurisdictional\nallegation where the parent failed to challenge that basis\nbelow).\n         We reach a different conclusion with respect to\nthe allegation that father\u2019s mental health interferes with\nhis ability to parent. The evidence related to that allega-\ntion came from the testimony of two of the children, who\ndescribed that father \u201cwent a little crazy\u201d at one point,\nsomeone had put a \u201cspell\u201d or \u201chex\u201d on father, and he was\n\u201cseeing things.\u201d It is not apparent from the record that that\nevidence reflects \u201cmental health issues\u201d; to the extent that\nthe court relied on that evidence, without more information\nabout father\u2019s condition, it is insufficient in any event to sup-\nport a conclusion that there is a reasonable risk of harm to\nthe children as a result. See K. C. F., 282 Or App at 19-20\n(the record lacks evidence of the \u201cserious loss or injury to the\nchild that is reasonably likely to be realized\u201d with respect\nto the allegation (internal quotation marks omitted)). We\ntherefore reverse and remand the jurisdictional judgment\nfor the court to enter a judgment omitting allegation 2(E) as\na basis for jurisdiction.\n         Reversed and remanded for entry of judgment omit-\nting allegation 2(E) as a basis for jurisdiction; otherwise\naffirmed.\n\f",

H., 373 Or 26, 48-49, 559 P3d 395 (2024), and\naffirm.\n         We have reviewed the evidence and the juvenile\ncourt\u2019s findings and conclude that the juvenile court cor-\nrectly found that DHS made reasonable efforts and that\nfather had not made sufficient progress to have R return\nhome. In particular, as the juvenile court found, DHS offered\nfather extensive services over several years and father did\nnot engage in those services, save for visits. Although father\nargues that the services were not aimed at ameliorating\nthe single jurisdictional basis\u2014that father \u201cdoes not under-\nstand the basic needs of the child and lacks the skills and/or\nknowledge necessary to safely parent\u201d R\u2014the record reflects\nthat the services were directly related to that jurisdictional\nbasis. Given father\u2019s failure to engage in those services and\ngiven father\u2019s concerning conduct during the single service\nhe did engage in (visits), the juvenile court correctly con-\ncluded that father had not made sufficient progress to enable\nR to return to his care.\n        Affirmed.\n\f",

Plaintiff\nconcedes that we need to address the evidentiary issue only if\nwe agree with plaintiff on the instruction issue. We conclude\nthat the trial court did not err and therefore affirm.\n         Plaintiff brought this negligence action against\ndefendant alleging that she was injured when, as she walked\nout of defendant\u2019s Wood Village store while leaving a voice-\nmail message on her cell phone, she slipped on a three-foot\nby five-foot laminated plastic sign, which had fallen from its\nstand onto the public walkway. Plaintiff alleged that she was\ninjured when she slipped on the sign, causing her right foot\nto slip from underneath her, and her left knee, hand, and\nshoulder to hit the ground. Plaintiff alleged that defendant\nwas negligent in securing the sign, in failing to discover that\nthe sign was on the ground, in failing to barricade the area,\nand in failing to monitor the public entryway of the store.\nPlaintiff sought damages for medical bills of $395,169.02 for\nthree back surgeries and other medical treatments, and for\nfuture projected medical bills of $60,000, and sought non-\neconomic damages of $1,000,000.\n         The sign belonged to defendant\u2019s Starbucks conces-\nsion, which was inside defendant\u2019s store. The Starbucks is\nrun by defendant\u2019s employees. It is undisputed that defen-\ndant\u2019s employees did not place the sign on the ground and\ndid not know that it had fallen out of its frame. Plaintiff did\nnot assert that defendant had constructive knowledge that\nthe sign was on the ground.\n         Plaintiff conceded below that res ipsa loquitur does\nnot apply to typical slip-and-fall claims, which typically\ninvolve substances on a floor that might have been handled\n\f114                                     Fisk v. Fred Meyer Stores, Inc.\n\nby customers. But plaintiff distinguished this claim from\nthose, arguing that plaintiff\u2019s claim was more in the nature\nof a \u201cstandard\u201d \u201cconditions\u201d claim, because the sign was not\na substance or thing normally handled by a customer and\nwas within defendant\u2019s exclusive control. Plaintiff requested\na uniform jury instruction on res ipsa loquitur, contending\nthat the evidence was sufficient to give the jury a rational\nbasis to find that it was more probable than not that defen-\ndant\u2019s failure to exercise reasonable care was the cause of\nthe accident.1 The requested res ipsa loquitur instruction\nstated:\n    \u201cThe law assumes that all persons have obeyed the law and\n    have been free from negligence.\n    \u201cHowever, you may find that the defendant was negligent if\n    you find that the incident that caused damage to the plain-\n    tiff is one that, in the normal course of events, would not\n    have occurred unless the defendant was negligent.\u201d\n\n    1\n      We recently discussed res ipsa loquitur in Jackson v. KA-3 Associates, LLC,\n331 Or App 574, 546 P3d 950, rev allowed, 373 Or 81, 546 P3d 950 (2024):\n         \u201cIn the absence of evidence of negligence or the exact cause of an acci-\n    dent, a factfinder can infer negligence and causation under res ipsa loquitur,\n    a rule of circumstantial evidence, if the \u2018accident is of a kind which ordinarily\n    would not have occurred in the absence of the defendant\u2019s negligence, even\n    though it is impossible to determine the specific way in which the defendant\n    was negligent.\u2019 [Hagler v. Coastal Farm Holdings, Inc., 354 Or 132, 146, 309\n    P3d 1073 (2013)]. The plaintiff bears the burden of submitting evidence that\n    the plaintiff\u2019s injury is of the sort that, more likely than not, was caused by\n    negligence on the part of the defendant and therefore is entitled to an infer-\n    ence of negligence under res ipsa loquitur. Id. Whether a reasonable juror\n    could draw such an inference is an issue of law to be determined by the court.\n    Fieux v. Cardiovascular & Thoracic Clinic, P.C., 159 Or App 637, 640, 978 P2d\n    429, rev den, 329 Or 318 (1999).\n         \u201cIn Ritchie v. Thomas et al., 190 Or 95, 114, 224 P2d 543 (1950), the\n    court explained that res ipsa loquitur is a rule of evidence that allows an\n    inference of negligence, rather than a presumption, under certain limited\n    circumstances:\n         \u201c \u2018[T]he fact of injury alone does not raise an inference of negligence. An\n    inference of negligence may arise only when injury is caused by an instru-\n    mentality which is under the control and management of the defendant, and\n    when the accident is such as, in the ordinary course of events does not hap-\n    pen, if those who have the management use ordinary care.\u2019 \u201d\n331 Or App at 582. See also Kaufman v. Fisher, 230 Or 626, 636-40, 371 P2d 948\n(1962) (describing the question under res ipsa loquitur thusly: \u201cCould it have been\nreasonably found by the jury that the accident which occurred in this case is of\na kind which more probable than not would not have occurred in the absence of\nnegligence upon the part of [the defendant]?\u201d).\n\fCite as 339 Or App 112 (2025)                                    115\n\n        The court declined to give the res ipsa loquitur\ninstruction, explaining,\n   \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a situation for res ipsa because that would\n   require * * * that the sign and the A-frame be in the exclu-\n   sive control or almost exclusive control of the Defendant.\n   And being in a public area like that, * * * I don\u2019t think\n   there\u2019s a basis for that.\u201d\nInstead, the court gave general instructions relating to\npremises liability as well as an instruction on slip-and-fall:\n   \u201cA possessor of premises has a duty to make the premise\n   reasonably safe for an invitee\u2019s visit. The possessor must\n   exercise reasonable care to discover any condition that cre-\n   ates an unreasonable risk of harm to the invitee and either\n   eliminate the condition or warn any foreseeable invitee of\n   the risk so the invitee can avoid the harm. If the condition\n   cannot be encountered with reasonable safety, even if the\n   danger was known and appreciated by the invitee, the pos-\n   sessor is obligated to do more than warn. The possessor\n   must take reasonable and feasible steps to eliminate the\n   danger.\n   \u201cOregon law does not automatically impose liability against\n   a business for every slip and fall accident that occurs on the\n   premises. The role of the possessor is not that of an insurer\n   against accidents upon the premises, even as to persons who\n   they have invited to appear. Excuse me. Invited to enter.\n   The mere fact that an invitee was injured on the premises\n   does not, by itself, give rise to an inference of negligence.\n   \u201cIn premises liability cases like this one, where the Plaintiff\n   claims to have been injured by slipping on a sign on the\n   ground of the Defendant\u2019s store, liability will not attach\n   unless the Defendant had actual or constructive knowledge\n   of the sign on the ground and failed to use reasonable care\n   to remove it.\n   \u201cTo prove the Defendant had knowledge of the sign on the\n   ground the Plaintiff must prove one of three things: (1) the\n   sign was placed on the ground by the Defendant, or (2) the\n   Defendant knew that the sign was there and failed to use\n   reasonable diligence to remove it, or (3) the sign had been\n   on the ground for such a length of time that the Defendant\n   should, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, have discov-\n   ered it and removed it.\u201d\n\f116                            Fisk v. Fred Meyer Stores, Inc.\n\n         The jury returned a verdict for defendant. On\nappeal, plaintiff does not assign error to the instructions\nthat the trial court gave or to the trial court\u2019s characteri-\nzation of the claim as involving a slip and fall but argues\nthat the court erred in failing to give plaintiff\u2019s requested\nres ipsa loquitur instruction. \u201cAs a general rule, parties in\na civil action are entitled to jury instructions on their the-\nory of the case if their requested instructions correctly state\nthe law, are based on the current pleadings in the case, and\nare supported by evidence.\u201d Vandeveere-Pratt v. Portland\nHabilitation Center, 242 Or App 554, 557-58, 259 P3d 9\n(2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). Plaintiff con-\ntends that the evidence at trial supported the giving of the\nres ipsa loquitur instruction and that the trial court erred\nin reasoning that res ipsa loquitur was precluded by the fact\nthat the sign was located in a public area and therefore not\nwithin defendant\u2019s exclusive control.\n          Defendant responds, as argued below, that plain-\ntiff\u2019s claim is a \u201cslip and fall\u201d claim to which the doctrine\nof res ipsa loquitur does not apply. See German v. Kienow\u2019s\nFood Stores, 246 Or 334, 336, 425 P2d 523 (1967) (stating\nthat Oregon has not \u201cyet adopted the rule of res ipsa loqui-\ntur in \u2018slip and fall\u2019 cases, and it is still necessary to supply\nsome proof of fault\u201d). Defendant argues, further, that it was\nnot defendant\u2019s burden to show that the sign was not within\ndefendant\u2019s exclusive control but plaintiff\u2019s burden to show\nthat the sign and its frame were within defendant\u2019s exclusive\ncontrol, and that she has failed to do that. In her reply brief,\nplaintiff argues that res ipsa loquitur does not depend on the\n\u201cmechanism of injury,\u201d i.e., whether the injury occurred as a\nresult of a slip and fall, but on whether the evidence would\nallow a finding that the probability of the defendant\u2019s negli-\ngence is greater than the probability of other causes.\n        As the trial court correctly instructed, the general\nrule of premises liability is that possessors of land must\n\u201cmake their property reasonably safe for their invitees.\u201d\nHughes v. Wilson, 345 Or 491, 497, 199 P3d 305 (2008). That\nduty requires the possessor to exercise due care to discover\nconditions on the premises that create an unreasonable risk\nof harm to invitees or warn them of the risk so as to enable\n\fCite as 339 Or App 112 (2025)                                  117\n\nthem to avoid the harm. Woolston v. Wells, 297 Or 548, 557-\n58, 687 P2d 144 (1984).\n          Our caselaw and that of the Supreme Court make\nclear that slip-and-fall claims involving substances or objects\non the floor or ground are simply a subcategory of premises\nliability to which general premises liability standards apply.\nHagler v. Coastal Farm Holdings, Inc., 354 Or 132, 141, 309\nP3d 1073 (2013); Moorehead v. Tri-Met, 273 Or App 54, 359\nP3d 314 (2015), rev den, 358 Or 550 (2016) (\u201cWe conclude that\nthe distinction plaintiff seeks to draw between \u2018condition\u2019\ncases and \u2018foreign substance\u2019 cases is nonexistent.\u201d). When a\nclaim involves a substance or object on the floor or ground,\nthe liability of a business owner depends on evidence that\nthe owner knew or should have known about the fallen sub-\nstance or object. Hagler, 354 Or at 142. In the context of a\nslip-and-fall claim, proof of that liability is captured by the\nthree-factor test described in the caselaw:\n      \u201c(a) That the substance was placed there by the occu-\n   pant, or\n      \u201c(b) That the occupant knew that the substance was\n   there and failed to use reasonable diligence to remove it, or\n       \u201c(c) That the foreign substance had been there for such\n   a length of time that the occupant should, by the exercise of\n   reasonable diligence, have discovered and removed it.\u201d\nCowden v. Earley et al, 214 Or 384, 387, 327 P2d 1109 (1958).\n         Although reported slip-and-fall cases have most\ngenerally involved foreign substances on a floor that cause\na person to slip, Oregon courts have also applied slip-and-\nfall analysis to cases in which an invitee slips on or trips\nover an object in the aisle of a store. See, e.g., Lee v. Meier &\nFrank Co., 166 Or 600, 114 P2d 136 (1941) (holding that a\ncustomer who had tripped over a pillow in the aisle of a store\nfailed to state a claim against the owner of the store); see\nalso Hinchman v. UC Market, LLC, 270 Or App 561, 567 n 3,\n348 P3d 328 (2015) (observing that \u201cslip and fall\u201d analysis\napplied in a claim involving a negligently placed door mat).\n          We agree with defendant that because plain-\ntiff slipped on an object on the ground, plaintiff\u2019s claim is\ncorrectly characterized as a slip-and-fall claim. The trial\n\f118                                    Fisk v. Fred Meyer Stores, Inc.\n\ncourt\u2019s jury instructions therefore correctly described plain-\ntiff\u2019s burden. And, as the Supreme Court held in Kienow\u2019s\nFood Stores, 246 Or at 336, the trial court correctly held\nthat, because the claim involved a slip and fall, the doctrine\nof res ipsa loquitur did not apply.2\n         But even if plaintiff were correct that res ipsa loqui-\ntur could apply in the context of this slip-and-fall claim,\nwe would conclude that the trial court did not err in reject-\ning the requested res ipsa loquitur instruction here. That\nis because, in determining whether to give the requested\ninstruction, it was the trial court\u2019s role to determine whether\nthere was evidence from which the jury could find that the\naccident was of a kind more likely than not attributable to\ndefendant\u2019s negligence. Hammer v. Fred Meyer Stores, Inc.,\n242 Or App 185, 194, 255 P3d 598 (2011) (\u201c \u2018The determina-\ntion of where the probabilities lie must, ordinarily, be made\nupon the basis of past experience as it is seen and appraised\nby the court.\u201d\u2019 (quoting Kaufman, 230 Or at 639)). As the\ntrial court concluded, a jury could not plausibly have found\nthat it was more probable than not that defendant\u2019s failure\nto exercise reasonable care was the cause of the accident,\nbecause there were a number of causes other than defen-\ndant\u2019s alleged negligence that could have caused the sign to\nbe on the ground and plaintiff to fall. See Hammer, 242 Or\nApp at 190-91 (\u201cRes ipsa loquitur is a rule of circumstantial\nevidence that permits a jury to infer both negligence and\ncausation if the harm that occurs is \u2018\u201dof a kind that which\nmore probably than not would not have occurred in the\nabsence of negligence on the part of the defendant\u201d\u2019 McKee\nElectric Co. v. Carson Oil Co., 301 Or 339, 353, 723 P2d 288\n(1986) (quoting Watzig v. Tobin, 292 Or 645, 649, 642 P2d\n651 (1982)).\u201d). We conclude, therefore, that the trial court did\nnot err in declining to give plaintiff\u2019s requested instruction.\n         Plaintiff concedes that her second assignment of\nerror, in which she contends that the trial court erred in\n\n     2\n       We do not conclude here that res ipsa loquitur could never apply to a claim\nin which a business invitee slips and falls in the defendant\u2019s premises. But appli-\ncation of the presumption of res ipsa loquitur to a claim like plaintiff\u2019s, where,\nas here, a business invitee slips on a substance or object on the business own-\ner\u2019s floor or ground, is inconsistent with the three-factor inquiry that generally\napplies to the determination of liability in those types of cases.\n\fCite as 339 Or App 112 (2025)                             119\n\nadmitting testimony of plaintiff\u2019s treating physician, is con-\ntingent on our acceptance of plaintiff\u2019s first assignment of\nerror, and we therefore do not reach it.\n        Affirmed.\n\f",

The Starbucks is\nrun by defendant\u2019s employees. It is undisputed that defen-\ndant\u2019s employees did not place the sign on the ground and\ndid not know that it had fallen out of its frame. Plaintiff did\nnot assert that defendant had constructive knowledge that\nthe sign was on the ground.\n         Plaintiff conceded below that res ipsa loquitur does\nnot apply to typical slip-and-fall claims, which typically\ninvolve substances on a floor that might have been handled\n\f114                                     Fisk v.

The possessor\n   must take reasonable and feasible steps to eliminate the\n   danger.\n   \u201cOregon law does not automatically impose liability against\n   a business for every slip and fall accident that occurs on the\n   premises.

Our conclusion that DHS failed to prove that petitioner intentionally\nfailed to report her household composition resolves that allegation and obviates\nthe need to address the third assignment.\n\f172                      Garrett-Sims v. Dept. of Human Services\n\nmember of [her] household.\u201d (Boldface and uppercase omit-\nted). During the contested hearing to substantiate that alle-\ngation, the Department of Human Services (DHS) offered\nevidence that Levi provided petitioner\u2019s address for his\nemployment applications, car registration, financial records,\nas well as a note from petitioner\u2019s landlord. In that note,\npetitioner\u2019s landlord listed Levi as an occupant of the apart-\nment, but admitted that he was a \u201chands off\u201d landlord and\nthus was \u201cnot sure\u201d who was living in the apartment. He\nalso stated that he met the family through his ex-girlfriend\nbut, after that relationship ended in October 2018, he had\n\u201clost touch\u201d with petitioner and Levi.\n        Petitioner disputed that Levi resided with her full-\ntime. She testified that Levi lives elsewhere \u201cninety-five\npercent of the time\u201d and that he uses her address only for\nmailing purposes. Levi was not listed on the lease of the\napartment. And in his own application for SNAP benefits,\nLevi wrote that he lives at petitioner\u2019s residence only \u201cpart-\ntime\u201d and that he also lives in his car.\n         The ALJ concluded that petitioner committed an\nIPV because the \u201coverwhelming evidence in the record\ndemonstrate[d] that\u201d petitioner intentionally misrepre-\nsented her household income by not reporting that Levi lived\nwith her.2 On appeal, petitioner contends that neither sub-\nstantial evidence nor reason supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion.\n         We \u201cshall set aside or remand the order if [we] find[ ]\nthat the order is not supported by substantial evidence in\nthe record.

Notwithstanding\nthe fact that petitioner did not bear the burden of proof at the hearing, there was\nevidence in the record that the couple had lived separately due to domestic vio-\nlence, and petitioner testified that DHS told her to not list Levi on the application\nif she was experiencing domestic violence, out of concern for her safety.\n\fNonprecedential Memo Op: 339 Or App 170 (2025)                             173\n\n         We conclude that substantial evidence does not sup-\nport the finding that petitioner intentionally misrepresented\nher household composition. The ALJ relied exclusively on\nthe facts that Levi listed petitioner\u2019s address on various doc-\numents and that petitioner\u2019s landlord was aware that Levi\nwas at petitioner\u2019s apartment at some point during 2018 to\nconclude that there was \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d that peti-\ntioner misrepresented Levi\u2019s housing status. However, Levi\u2019s\nuse of the address is not on its own sufficient to prove by\nclear and convincing evidence that petitioner intentionally\nprovided false information on her applications, particularly\nwhen evidence in the record supports the contention that\nLevi lived in multiple places. The only other evidence sup-\nporting the ALJ\u2019s decision\u2014petitioner\u2019s landlord\u2019s note stat-\ning that Levi lived there\u2014also states that the landlord had\n\u201clost touch\u201d with petitioner and was unaware of who was\nin the apartment during most of the time period relevant\nto the hearing. Moreover, there was significant countervail-\ning evidence, including petitioner\u2019s testimony, the lease, and\nLevi\u2019s benefits applications.3 Accordingly, we conclude that\nthe ALJ\u2019s finding that DHS proved by clear and convinc-\ning evidence that petitioner intentionally misrepresented\nher household composition is not supported by substantial\nevidence. See Smithee v. Employment Dept., 228 Or App\n346, 350, 208 P3d 956 (2009) (concluding that substantial\nevidence did not support the ALJ\u2019s finding that claimant,\nwho undisputedly went over his break time, intentionally\nviolated a timekeeping regulation because there was coun-\ntervailing evidence that his employer allowed him to take\nunreported breaks and lacked a clear policy on work-break\nreporting).\n           Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n    3\n      Petitioner sought an extension of time, her first request, to obtain addi-\ntional evidence given that DHS had a year to prepare its case and her Oregon\nLaw Center attorney had less than three weeks to marshal evidence, and, addi-\ntionally, was scheduled to be out of the office during the hearing.

Property and Casualty Ins. Co. of Hartford\n\n            TOOKEY, P. J.\n         Plaintiffs Richard and Rita Griffith lost their home\nin a fire. They filed a claim with Hartford, their homeown-\ner\u2019s insurer. Hartford accepted the claim and made several\npayments and continued to adjust the claim. But plaintiffs\nbelieved that Hartford was not acting with sufficient alac-\nrity, and they retained attorney Vance. Vance filed a civil\naction against Hartford, alleging breach of contract, inten-\ntional infliction of emotional distress, and negligence, and\nseeking damages and prejudgment interest.\n         The complaint and Hartford\u2019s answer were the only\nfilings relating to Hartford in plaintiffs\u2019 civil action. Shortly\nthereafter, plaintiffs and Hartford executed a \u201cRelease and\nSettlement Agreement,\u201d under which the parties settled\nplaintiffs\u2019 insurance and breach of contract claims \u201cand\nall related controversies.\u201d Plaintiffs then filed a motion for\nsummary judgment in the proceeding, seeking prejudgment\ninterest from Hartford under ORS 82.010,1 on the theory\nthat the amount due on plaintiffs\u2019 insurance claim became\n\n     1\n       ORS 82.010 provides, in part:\n          \u201c(1) The rate of interest for the following transactions, if the parties have\n     not otherwise agreed to a rate of interest, is nine percent per annum and is\n     payable on:\n          \u201c(a) All moneys after they become due; but open accounts bear interest\n     from the date of the last item thereof.\n          \u201c(b) Money received to the use of another and retained beyond a reason-\n     able time without the owner\u2019s express or implied consent.\n          \u201c(c) Money due or to become due where there is a contract to pay interest\n     and no rate specified.\n          \u201c(2) Except as provided in this subsection, the rate of interest on judg-\n     ments for the payment of money is nine percent per annum. The following\n     apply as described:\n          \u201c(a) Interest on a judgment under this subsection accrues from the date\n     of the entry of the judgment unless the judgment specifies another date.\n          \u201c(b) Interest on a judgment under this subsection is simple interest,\n     unless otherwise provided by contract.\n          \u201c(c) Interest accruing from the date of the entry of a judgment shall also\n     accrue on interest that accrued before the date of entry of a judgment.\n          \u201c(d) Interest under this subsection shall also accrue on attorney fees and\n     costs entered as part of the judgment.\n          \u201c(e) A judgment on a contract bearing more than nine percent interest\n     shall bear interest at the same rate provided in the contract as of the date of\n     entry of the judgment.\u201d\n\fCite as 339 Or App 40 (2025)                                 43\n\nascertainable (and therefore \u201cdue\u201d) thirty days after the\nclaim was filed and that prejudgment interest was owed\nas provided in ORS 82.010(1), on \u201c[a]ll moneys after they\nbecome due.\u201d The trial court denied the motion, determin-\ning that it was premature, as there had been no judgment\nentered against Hartford.\n         Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their remaining\nclaims against Hartford. They then filed a petition for attor-\nney fees and costs and also refiled their motion for summary\njudgment seeking prejudgment interest. The trial court\nentered what was captioned a \u201csupplemental judgment,\u201d\ndenying plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on their\nrequest for prejudgment interest. In a limited judgment, the\ntrial court denied plaintiffs\u2019 request for costs but awarded\nplaintiffs their attorney fees of $221,179.27.\n         Plaintiffs appeal from the supplemental judgment,\nassigning error to the denial of their motion for summary\njudgment on their claim of prejudgment interest and appeal\nfrom a limited judgment denying costs. Hartford cross-\nappeals from the trial court\u2019s limited judgment awarding\nplaintiffs attorney fees, asserting that the trial court erro-\nneously awarded fees on a contingent or percentage-of-re-\ncovery basis. On plaintiffs\u2019 appeal of the supplemental judg-\nment denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment, we\nconclude that the supplemental judgment is not an appeal-\nable judgment and therefore dismiss the appeal; on plain-\ntiffs\u2019 appeal of the limited judgment, we conclude that the\ntrial court did not err or abuse its discretion in rejecting\nplaintiffs\u2019 request to recover their costs. On Hartford\u2019s cross-\nappeal of the limited judgment, we conclude that the trial\ncourt abused its discretion in determining that a fee based\non a contingency or a percentage of recovery\u2014rather than\nbased on hours worked\u2014was a reasonable fee, and, there-\nfore, reverse and remand for reconsideration of the limited\njudgment awarding fees.\n        In their first assignment of error, plaintiffs contend\nthat the trial court erred in denying their motion for sum-\nmary judgment on their claim for what they characterize\nas \u201cprejudgment interest.\u201d As noted, plaintiffs filed their\nmotion after they had reached a settlement with Hartford\n\f44   Griffith v. Property and Casualty Ins. Co. of Hartford\n\non their insurance claim and had fully released Hartford on\nthe breach of contract claims, which were the only claims\nthat could support an award of prejudgment interest, had a\njudgment been entered. But there was no general judgment\nand no limited monetary judgment for plaintiffs on either\nthe insurance claim or on plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract or\ntort claims. On the motion, the trial court entered a docu-\nment captioned \u201cSupplemental Judgment\u201d in which it stated\nthat the summary judgment was \u201cdenied.\u201d Plaintiffs con-\ntend that the trial court erred in denying their motion for\nsummary judgment, because the amount of interest owed to\nplaintiffs as of the date that Hartford should have paid pol-\nicy limits (which plaintiffs assert was within 30 days after\nplaintiffs\u2019 loss) was readily ascertainable, and prejudgment\ninterest was therefore awardable under ORS 82.010.\n         Hartford responds that the court\u2019s denial of the\nmotion is either not reviewable or was correct on its mer-\nits, because there is no basis for an award of prejudgment\ninterest in the absence of a judgment. Additionally, even\nassuming reviewability, Hartford asserts that the record as\nto plaintiffs\u2019 entitlement to prejudgment interest includes\ndisputed issues of material fact.\n        For several reasons, the trial court\u2019s ruling is not\nreviewable. First and foremost, the document captioned\n\u201cSupplemental Judgment,\u201d which simply denied plaintiffs\u2019\nmotion for summary judgment, is not an appealable judg-\nment. That is because it is not a proper supplemental judg-\nment, as no general judgment had been entered on plaintiffs\u2019\nbreach of contract claims. ORS 18.005(17) (A supplemental\njudgment is \u201ca judgment that may be rendered after a gen-\neral judgment pursuant to a legal authority.\u201d).\n         Secondly, even if the supplemental judgment were\nappealable, the denial of the motion for summary judg-\nment would not be reviewable. That is because, with limited\nexceptions, the denial of a motion for summary judgment\nis not reviewable on appeal. See Martin v. State of Oregon,\n331 Or App 225, 226 n 1, 545 P3d 776 (2024) (stating rule);\nFarnsworth v. Meadowland Ranches, Inc., 321 Or App 814,\n819, 519 P3d 153 (2022) (noting that \u201ca trial court\u2019s denial\nof summary judgment is generally unreviewable on appeal,\n\fCite as 339 Or App 40 (2025)                                               45\n\nwith limited exceptions,\u201d such as when the motion rests on\n\u201cpurely legal contentions\u201d). For example, in a case that has\ngone to trial, the denial of a summary judgment motion is\nsubject to review on appeal if the motion rested on a \u201cpurely\nlegal\u201d contention. Seidel v. Time Ins. Co., 157 Or App 556,\n560, 970 P2d 255 (1998). And when, for example, the appeal\narises from cross-motions for summary judgment, the grant-\ning of one motion and the denial of the other are both review-\nable. Eden Gate, Inc. v. D&L Excavating & Trucking, Inc.,\n178 Or App 610, 622, 37 P3d 233 (2002). This case does not\ninvolve either of those limited exceptions. Thus, we decline\nto address the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 challenge in their first\nassignment of error to the trial court\u2019s denial of their motion\nfor summary judgment seeking prejudgment interest.\n         In their second assignment of error, plaintiffs chal-\nlenge a limited judgment of the trial court declining to award\nthem costs on their claims against Hartford. Plaintiffs con-\ntend that, because attorney fees to which they are entitled\nunder ORS 742.061(1) are awarded \u201cas part of the costs of\nthe action,\u201d they are necessarily entitled to costs. We do not\nagree. ORCP 68 authorizes a court to award costs to a pre-\nvailing party. Having settled their contract claims against\nHartford and voluntarily dismissed their tort claims, we\nagree with Hartford that it was within the trial court\u2019s dis-\ncretion to determine whether plaintiffs prevailed in their\naction and were entitled to costs; the trial court did not\nabuse its discretion in determining that plaintiffs did not\nprevail in their action. See ORCP 54 A(3).2\n         We move on to Hartford\u2019s cross-appeal, in which\nHartford challenges the limited judgment awarding to\nplaintiffs attorney fees based on a percentage of plaintiffs\u2019\nrecovery rather than based on an hourly rate. What consti-\ntutes reasonable attorney fees is within the sound discre-\ntion of the court ordering the fee award. See ORS 20.075(3)\n(providing that \u201cthe decision of the court as to the amount\nof the award\u201d is reviewed for \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d). Hartford\n   2\n     ORCP 54 A(3)provides:\n       \u201cWhen an action is dismissed under this section, the judgment may\n   include any costs and disbursements, including attorney fees, provided by\n   contract, statute, or rule. Unless the circumstances indicate otherwise, the\n   dismissed party shall be considered the prevailing party.\u201d\n\f46      Griffith v. Property and Casualty Ins. Co. of Hartford\n\ndoes not dispute that plaintiffs were entitled to attorney fees\nunder ORS 742.061(1), which provides:\n     \u201c[I]f settlement is not made within six months from the\n     date proof of loss is filed with an insurer and an action is\n     brought in any court of this state upon any policy of insur-\n     ance of any kind or nature, and the plaintiff\u2019s recovery\n     exceeds the amount of any tender made by the defendant\n     in such action, a reasonable amount to be fixed by the court\n     as attorney fees shall be taxed as part of the costs of the\n     action and any appeal thereon.\u201d\n(Emphasis added.) Hartford acknowledges that plaintiffs\nwere entitled to attorney fees, because Hartford did not pay\nplaintiffs for the full loss within six months from the date\nof proof of loss. Hartford only disputes the basis on which\nthe trial court calculated the attorney fees and the amount\nawarded.\n         ORS 20.075 outlines a number of factors that the\ncourt must consider in setting a reasonable fee within its\ndiscretion, such as the time and labor required in the pro-\nceeding and the results obtained. Thoens v. Safeco Ins. Co.,\n317 Or App 727, 744, 507 P3d 284, adh\u2019d to as modified on\nrecons, 319 Or App 450, 508 P3d 1001 (2022) (\u201cA court has\nthe discretion to determine what amounts to a reasonable\nfee by considering the factors in ORS 20.075(1) and (2). ORS\n20.075(3) (providing that \u2018the decision of the court as to the\namount of the award\u2019 is reviewed for \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019)).\nHartford does not dispute that determining the amount\nof fees was within the trial court\u2019s discretion and that we\nreview that determination for an abuse of discretion. But\nHartford contends that, under the circumstances of this\ncase, the trial court abused its discretion in basing the fee\naward on a percentage of plaintiffs\u2019 recovery on their insur-\nance claim rather than on the \u201clodestar\u201d calculation\u2014a fee\nbased on an hourly rate. We agree with Hartford that, under\nthe circumstances here, the trial court abused its discretion\nin determining that a percentage of recovery was a reason-\nable basis on which calculate the amount of the attorney fee.\n        In any case in which an award of attorney fees is\nauthorized or required by statute, ORS 20.075(2) requires\nthe court to consider the factors in ORS 20.075(1) and\n\fCite as 339 Or App 40 (2025)                                      47\n\n20.075(2) in determining a reasonable amount of the fee. In\nFriends of Columbia Gorge v. Energy Fac. Siting Coun., 367\nOr 258, 267, 477 P3d 1191 (2020), the court stated,\n   \u201cThose factors are frequently captured by the \u2018lodestar\u2019\n   approach, under which a fee award is \u2018based on a reason-\n   able hourly rate, multiplied by a reasonable number of\n   hours devoted to work on the case, with certain adjust-\n   ments potentially made to that amount for factors such\n   as the risk of loss and the quality of the attorney\u2019s work.\u2019\n   Strawn[ v. Farmers Ins. Co., 353 Or 210, 217, 297 P3d 439\n   (2013)].\u201d\nIn contrast to the lodestar method, under which the fee is\ndetermined based on a reasonable hourly rate multiplied by\na reasonable number of hours devoted to work on the case,\nwith possible adjustments for factors such as the risk of loss\nand the quality of the attorney\u2019s work, the percent-of-recov-\nery method sets the fee by calculating the total recovery\nsecured by the attorney and awarding a reasonable per-\ncentage of that recovery. In general, the lodestar method\nis thought to more directly account for the amount of work\ndone; the percent-of-recovery method more directly reflects\nthe result achieved. Strawn, 353 Or at 219 (discussing the\ntwo approaches in the context of class-action claims involv-\ning fee-shifting statutes and common funds). The lodestar\nmethod is the prevailing method for determining the rea-\nsonableness of a fee award in cases, such as this, involv-\ning a statutory fee-shifting award, even when, as here, the\ninsured has retained counsel on a contingency-fee basis. Id.\nThe percentage-of-fund basis is a particularly appropriate\nmethod when there is a risk of recovery, when litigation has\nbeen extensive, or when the recovery involves a common\nfund from which attorney fees can be paid. See id. at 221.\n          Whichever method for the calculation of an award\nof fees is chosen, the amount awarded under ORS 742.061(1)\nmust be reasonable; a windfall award of attorney fees is to\nbe avoided. See ZRZ Realty v. Beneficial Fire and Casualty\nIns. Co., 255 Or App 524, 556-57, 300 P3d 1224 (2013) (The\n\u201cpotential for a windfall\u201d in an award of attorney fees \u201cis a\nfactor that the court can consider in setting a reasonable\nattorney fee.\u201d). Here, for the following reasons, we agree\nwith Hartford that the award the trial court made based on\n\f48    Griffith v. Property and Casualty Ins. Co. of Hartford\n\na percentage of plaintiffs\u2019 insurance recovery resulted in a\nwindfall that plaintiffs failed to establish was reasonable.\n          There was never a dispute or litigation as to\nHartford\u2019s liability for coverage of plaintiffs\u2019 insurance\nclaim; the claim was immediately accepted by Hartford, and\nwhen plaintiffs retained their attorney and filed this action,\nHartford had already made several payments and was con-\ntinuing to adjust the claim. And because, before plaintiffs\u2019\ncounsel was retained, the claim had not fully resolved within\nsix months of proof of loss, there was never doubt that an\nattorney retained by plaintiffs would be entitled to fees\nunder ORS 742.061(1), because Hartford had not made a\ntender of the full amount that it ultimately paid under the\npolicy. Because plaintiffs\u2019 counsel did not keep time records,\nthere is no evidence, other than filings, as to how much time\nhe spent on the case. Prior to the parties\u2019 settlement and\nrelease, there was minimal litigation by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\n(the filing of a complaint) with respect to plaintiffs\u2019 claims\nagainst Hartford. A delay in adjusting plaintiffs\u2019 claim was\ncaused by circumstances outside of the parties\u2019 control,\nincluding plaintiffs\u2019 remote location, winter weather, the dif-\nficulty locating a contractor to do cleanup, and the pandemic.\nBut there was never a risk that plaintiffs would not receive\nbenefits under the policy or that their attorney would not be\nentitled to a reasonable attorney fee under ORS 742.061(1).\nThe case was not complex. It did not involve a \u201ccommon fund,\u201d\nwhich might justify a fee based on the percentage of recov-\nery. See Strawn 353 Or at 217. And despite having agreed to\ndo so in his fee agreement with plaintiffs, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\ndid not keep or provide time records of the hours spent on the\nclaim against Hartford, against which the trial court could\nhave evaluated whether the lodestar method would be suffi-\ncient to reasonably compensate plaintiffs\u2019 counsel.\n         Plaintiffs, as the party seeking an award of fees,\nhad the burden of establishing the reasonableness of the fee\namount under either method. Hillsboro v. Maint. & Const.\nServ., 269 Or 169, 172, 523 P2d 1036 (1974) (where oppos-\ning party objects to attorney fee request, burden of proving\nreasonableness of fees rests on party seeking them). In light\nof the above-described circumstances, we conclude that the\n\fCite as 339 Or App 40 (2025)                               49\n\nrecord does not permit a conclusion that plaintiffs estab-\nlished the reasonableness of a fee award based on a percent-\nage of recovery, and that it was therefore an abuse of discre-\ntion by the trial court to determine that plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\nshould receive a fee under ORS 742.061(1) as a percentage of\nplaintiffs\u2019 recovery under the policy rather than under the\nlodestar method. We therefore reverse the award of attorney\nfees in the limited judgment and remand for reconsideration\nof the fee award.\n         On appeal of limited judgment, denial of costs\naffirmed; on appeal of supplemental judgment, appeal dis-\nmissed; on cross-appeal, limited judgment awarding attor-\nney fees reversed and remanded.\n\f",

United States, 582 US 357, 364-65, 137 S Ct\n1958, 198 L Ed 2d 476 (2017) (holding that, under the Sixth\n\fNonprecedential Memo Op: 339 Or App 158 (2025)           163\n\nAmendment to the United States Constitution, \u201cwhen a\ndefendant claims that his counsel\u2019s deficient performance\ndeprived him of a trial by causing him to accept a plea, the\ndefendant can show prejudice by demonstrating a reason-\nable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not\nhave pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to\ntrial\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n         That is, the evidence that trial counsel could have\nobtained was unlikely to have changed the outcome of a\ntrial. See Saroian v. State of Oregon, 154 Or App 112, 118,\n961 P2d 252 (1998) (\u201c[W]here the alleged error of counsel is\na failure to investigate or discover potentially exculpatory\nevidence, the determination whether the error \u2018prejudiced\u2019\nthe defendant by causing him to plead guilty rather than go\nto trial will depend on the likelihood that discovery of the\nevidence would have led counsel to change his recommenda-\ntion as to the plea. This assessment, in turn, will depend in\nlarge part on a prediction whether the evidence would have\nchanged the outcome of a trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks\nand emphases omitted.)). And the record supports the post-\nconviction court\u2019s implicit finding that the evidence that\npetitioner contends trial counsel should have discovered\nwith reasonable investigation would not have resulted in a\nbetter plea offer from the state.

And at that hearing, petitioner confirmed to\nthe trial court that she \u201cread the plea petition [or] had it\ntranslated into her native language,\u201d that she \u201cunder[stood]\nthe plea petition,\u201d that she had \u201can adequate opportunity\nto review the plea petition, * * * court processes, and [her]\ndecision to enter a guilty plea with [her] attorney,\u201d and that\nshe \u201cunderstood what it is [she] was doing by pleading guilty\nto two counts of assault in the second degree.\u201d She also con-\nfirmed that she did not \u201cneed more time to speak\u201d with her\nattorney before the court accepted her guilty pleas and that\nshe was \u201cin fact guilty of two counts of assault in the sec-\nond degree as domestic violence offenses.\u201d Based on those\nresponses, the trial court accepted petitioner\u2019s guilty plea.\n         Finally, petitioner did not produce evidence that she\nwas confused about any of the specific rights that she was\nwaiving by entering a plea or about the specific terms of\nthe plea itself. See Wilson v. Armenakis, 144 Or App 587,\n589, 928 P2d 354 (1996), rev den, 324 Or 560 (1997) (reject-\ning post-conviction petitioner\u2019s claim that his plea was not\nknowing and voluntary, where post-conviction court found\nthat the \u201cpetitioner executed a plea petition that set out the\nrights that he was waiving,\u201d that \u201ctrial counsel read the peti-\ntion to petitioner before he entered his guilty plea,\u201d and that,\n\u201cbefore accepting the plea, the trial court assured itself that\npetitioner\u2019s plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent\u201d).\n        Affirmed.\n\f",

We affirm.\n           We review the grant of an ORCP 21 motion to dis-\nmiss for legal error, Hernandez v. Catholic Health Initiatives,\n311 Or App 70, 72, 490 P3d 166 (2021), assuming \u201cthat all\nwell-pleaded facts are true and giv[ing] plaintiff the bene-\nfit of all favorable inferences that reasonably may be drawn\nfrom those factual allegations,\u201d Piazza v. Kellim, 360 Or 58,\n61, 377 P3d 492 (2016).1\n          Plaintiff entered Mt. Tabor Park, a city park owned\nby defendant, to recreate and \u201cwalk its trails.\u201d While walk-\ning on a paved road toward the exit of the park, plain-\ntiff stepped into a hole in the pavement and was severely\ninjured. Plaintiff sued defendant for negligence, and defen-\ndant moved to dismiss on the ground that, based on plain-\ntiff\u2019s complaint, the affirmative defense of recreational use\nimmunity applied and barred plaintiff\u2019s claim. See ORS\n105.682 (limiting liability of owner of land for certain inju-\nries that arise out of recreational use).2 The trial court\nagreed with defendant and dismissed plaintiff\u2019s complaint\nwith prejudice and denied her motion to replead, reasoning\n    1\n      The parties do not address, and we do not decide, whether ORCP 21 A is the\ncorrect procedural vehicle for the affirmative defense of recreational use immu-\nnity. Compare ORCP 21 A(1) (listing enumerated defenses available in motion to\ndismiss) with ORCP 19 B (listing defenses that a party \u201cshall\u201d plead, including\n\u201cany other matter constituting an * * * affirmative defense).\n    2\n      The recreational use immunity statute, ORS 105.682, in relevant part, pro-\nvides that:\n    \u201can owner of land is not liable in contract or tort for any personal injury,\n    death or property damage that arises out of the use of the land for recre-\n    ational purposes * * * when the owner of land either directly or indirectly\n    permits any person to use the land for recreational purposes * * *. The limita-\n    tion on liability provided by this section applies if the principal purpose for\n    entry upon the land is for recreational purposes * * * and is not affected if the\n    injury, death or damage occurs while the person entering land is engaging in\n    activities other than the use of the land for recreational purposes[.]\u201d\n\f102                                 Laxer v. City of Portland\n\nthat any amendment would be futile. On appeal, plaintiff\nasserts that the trial court erred in ruling that recreational\nuse immunity applied and in denying plaintiff the opportu-\nnity to replead her complaint.\n         First Assignment of Error. Plaintiff first assigns\nerror to the trial court\u2019s grant of defendant\u2019s motion to dis-\nmiss on the ground that recreational use immunity applied.\nOn appeal, plaintiff asserts three arguments: (1) defen-\ndant\u2019s affirmative actions in paving the roads and walk-\nways in Mt. Tabor and representing to the public that those\nroads and walkways were \u201caccessible\u201d constitute intentional\nconduct which renders recreational use immunity unavail-\nable to defendant, ORS 105.682(2) (\u201cThis section does not\nlimit the liability of an owner of land for intentional injury\nor damage.\u201d); (2) the elements of recreational use immunity\nwere not met, because plaintiff was not engaged in a recre-\national purpose at the time of her injury; and (3) the roads\nand paths of Mt. Tabor are like a public sidewalk\u2014which\nfall outside the scope of recreational immunity, because\nthey are used by the public for various purposes. See Landis\nv. Limbaugh, 282 Or App 284, 294, 385 P3d 1139 (2016),\nrev dismissed, 361 Or 351 (2017) (recreational use immunity\nunavailable to defendant for injury that occurred on regular\npedestrian sidewalk).\n         We do not address plaintiff\u2019s first argument, as it is\nunpreserved. See Summit RWP, Inc. v. Hallin, 334 Or App\n529, 535, 557 P3d 1113 (2024) (generally we will not consider\nargument based on new theory for the first time on appeal);\nJohn Hyland Const., Inc. v. Williamsen & Bleid, Inc., 287\nOr App 466, 471, 402 P3d 719 (2017) (\u201c[T]he purpose of an\nappeal is not to give the appellant an opportunity to pursue\na new theory that it did not rely on below.\u201d). And, assuming\nthat plaintiff\u2019s second argument is preserved, it is foreclosed\nby the text of the recreational use immunity statute and con-\ntrolling case law. Coleman v. Oregon Parks and Recreation\nDept., 347 Or 94, 102, 217 P3d 651 (2009) (noting that rec-\nreational use immunity extends \u201cas long as the injured per-\nson\u2019s principal purpose for entry is recreational, even if the\nperson was engaged in other nonrecreational activity at the\ntime of injury\u201d (citing ORS 105.682(1))).\n\fCite as 339 Or App 100 (2025)                                 103\n\nPlaintiff\u2019s last argument, as we understand it, is that (1) the\npaved walkways in Mt. Tabor are like the paved sidewalks\nto which recreational immunity did not apply in Landis and\n(2) the application of recreational immunity to some inju-\nries and not others would produce irrational results that we\nsought to avoid in Landis. 282 Or App at 295.\nPlaintiff extends Landis too far: although we held there that\ncertain kinds of generally available public land, like side-\nwalks, would be outside the scope of recreational use immu-\nnity, we expressly noted that some generally available land\nconnected with recreation would still be subject to immunity:\n   \u201cNowhere in legislative history do we find any suggestion\n   that recreational immunity would apply to streets or side-\n   walks that are already generally available to the public,\n   that are not attendant to parks or places of recreation, and\n   that the landowner has done nothing to \u2018make available\u2019 for\n   the statutorily specified recreational or similar uses.\u201d\nId. at 294 (emphasis added); see also Waggoner v. City of\nWoodburn, 196 Or App 715, 717, 103 P3d 648 (2004) (recre-\national use immunity applies to public city parks).\n          Lastly, we address a new, unbriefed argument,\nbrought up by plaintiff at oral argument for the first time,\nthat the location where plaintiff was injured\u2014a paved\naccess road within Mt. Tabor Park\u2014makes recreational use\nimmunity inapplicable to defendant. See ORS 105.688(1)(c)\n(2021), amended by Or Laws 2024, ch 64 \u00a7 7 (recreational\nuse immunity applies to \u201c[a]ll paths, trails, roads, * * * and\nother rights of way\u201d used to access land to recreate \u201cthat\nhave not been improved, designed or maintained for the spe-\ncific purpose of providing access for recreational purposes\u201d).\nThat new argument relies on Fields v. City of Newport, 326\nOr App 764, 533 P3d 384, rev den, 371 Or 476 (2023), in\nwhich we concluded that recreational use immunity would\nnot apply to a paved beach access trail used solely for access\nto the beach. Id. at 775. Although we are under no obligation\nto address that argument, we observe that it is foreclosed by\nour recent decision in Murphy v. City of Cannon Beach, 338\nOr App 104, 106-08, 108 n 2, ___ P3d ___ (2025) (holding\nthat ORS 105.688(1)(c) (2021) \u201cis relevant only where a plain-\ntiff is injured on land adjacent to the land that the person\n\f104                                Laxer v. City of Portland\n\nintends to use for recreational purposes\u201d (emphasis added)),\nand we decline to address it further, see ORAP 6.15(6) (\u201cIt\nis the general policy of Oregon appellate courts to prohibit\nreference at oral argument to any authority not cited either\nin a brief or in a pre-argument memorandum of additional\nauthorities.\u201d).\n          Second Assignment of Error. Plaintiff next contends\nthat the trial court erred by denying leave to amend her\ncomplaint. Plaintiff requested leave to amend \u201cin order to\nmore fully allege her purpose for being on the walkway in\nMt. Tabor, and to more fully articulate her position that the\nCity\u2019s affirmative acts and conduct were such that [plain-\ntiff] relied on the City\u2019s representations to her detriment.\u201d\n         We review a court\u2019s denial of leave to amend after\nan ORCP 21 A dismissal for an abuse of discretion. Caldeen\nConstruction v. Kemp, 248 Or App 82, 86, 273 P3d 174 (2012).\nA trial court\u2019s discretion to grant or deny motions to amend\na complaint after a motion to dismiss is not limitless; it is\nbounded by the requirement that motions to amend should\nbe liberally granted if amendment would preclude the entry\nof a judgment. Id.

Tabor Park, a city park owned\nby defendant, to recreate and \u201cwalk its trails.\u201d While walk-\ning on a paved road toward the exit of the park, plain-\ntiff stepped into a hole in the pavement and was severely\ninjured. Plaintiff sued defendant for negligence, and defen-\ndant moved to dismiss on the ground that, based on plain-\ntiff\u2019s complaint, the affirmative defense of recreational use\nimmunity applied and barred plaintiff\u2019s claim. See ORS\n105.682 (limiting liability of owner of land for certain inju-\nries that arise out of recreational use).2 The trial court\nagreed with defendant and dismissed plaintiff\u2019s complaint\nwith prejudice and denied her motion to replead, reasoning\n    1\n      The parties do not address, and we do not decide, whether ORCP 21 A is the\ncorrect procedural vehicle for the affirmative defense of recreational use immu-\nnity. Compare ORCP 21 A(1) (listing enumerated defenses available in motion to\ndismiss) with ORCP 19 B (listing defenses that a party \u201cshall\u201d plead, including\n\u201cany other matter constituting an * * * affirmative defense).\n    2\n      The recreational use immunity statute, ORS 105.682, in relevant part, pro-\nvides that:\n    \u201can owner of land is not liable in contract or tort for any personal injury,\n    death or property damage that arises out of the use of the land for recre-\n    ational purposes * * * when the owner of land either directly or indirectly\n    permits any person to use the land for recreational purposes * * *. The limita-\n    tion on liability provided by this section applies if the principal purpose for\n    entry upon the land is for recreational purposes * * * and is not affected if the\n    injury, death or damage occurs while the person entering land is engaging in\n    activities other than the use of the land for recreational purposes[.]\u201d\n\f102                                 Laxer v. City of Portland\n\nthat any amendment would be futile. On appeal, plaintiff\nasserts that the trial court erred in ruling that recreational\nuse immunity applied and in denying plaintiff the opportu-\nnity to replead her complaint.\n         First Assignment of Error. Plaintiff first assigns\nerror to the trial court\u2019s grant of defendant\u2019s motion to dis-\nmiss on the ground that recreational use immunity applied.\nOn appeal, plaintiff asserts three arguments: (1) defen-\ndant\u2019s affirmative actions in paving the roads and walk-\nways in Mt. Tabor and representing to the public that those\nroads and walkways were \u201caccessible\u201d constitute intentional\nconduct which renders recreational use immunity unavail-\nable to defendant, ORS 105.682(2) (\u201cThis section does not\nlimit the liability of an owner of land for intentional injury\nor damage.\u201d); (2) the elements of recreational use immunity\nwere not met, because plaintiff was not engaged in a recre-\national purpose at the time of her injury; and (3) the roads\nand paths of Mt. Tabor are like a public sidewalk\u2014which\nfall outside the scope of recreational immunity, because\nthey are used by the public for various purposes. See Landis\nv.

J.\n         Petitioner appeals a judgment denying his petition\nfor post-conviction relief from convictions for aggravated\nmurder with a firearm, attempted aggravated murder with\na firearm, first-degree assault with a firearm, second-degree\nassault with a firearm, and one count of unlawful use of a\nweapon. Petitioner was represented by a team of two attor-\nneys at trial. He alleges that his criminal trial counsel were\nconstitutionally inadequate and ineffective in a variety of\nrespects, and that the post-conviction court erred in deny-\ning relief on the alleged grounds of inadequacy and inef-\nfectiveness. We review the post-conviction court\u2019s denial of\npost-conviction relief for legal error, accepting the court\u2019s\nsupported implicit and explicit factual findings. Green v.\nFranke, 357 Or 301, 312, 350 P3d 188 (2015). Reviewing\nunder those standards, we affirm.\n          Legal Standards. At issue in this matter are par-\nallel claims of inadequate assistance of trial counsel under\nArticle I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution, and ineffec-\ntive assistance of trial counsel under the Sixth Amendment\nto the United States Constitution. To establish that his trial\ncounsel rendered inadequate assistance for purposes of\nArticle I, section 11, petitioner was required to prove two ele-\nments: (1) a performance element\u2014that trial counsel \u201cfailed\nto exercise reasonable professional skill and judgment\u201d; and\n(2) a prejudice element\u2014that \u201cpetitioner suffered prejudice\nas a result of counsel\u2019s inadequacy.\u201d Johnson v. Premo, 361\nOr 688, 699, 399 P3d 431 (2017). A functionally equivalent\ntwo-element standard governs petitioner\u2019s claim of ineffec-\ntive assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment. Id.\nTo prevail on that claim, petitioner was required to demon-\nstrate that \u201ctrial counsel\u2019s performance \u2018fell below an objec-\ntive standard of reasonableness\u2019 \u201d and also that \u201cthere was a\n\u2018reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional\nerrors, the result of the proceeding would have been differ-\nent.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 700 (quoting Strickland v. Washington, 466 US\n668, 694, 104 S Ct 2052, 80 L Ed 2d 674 (1984)).\n        Failure to File Motion to Suppress. In his first\nassignment of error, which is the only assignment of error\nasserted in the brief filed by counsel, petitioner contends\n\fNonprecedential Memo Op: 339 Or App 151 (2025)           153\n\nthat the post-conviction court erred by denying relief on his\nclaim that his trial counsel were inadequate and ineffective\nfor not moving to suppress statements that he made in a\npost-arrest interview. In denying relief, the post-conviction\ncourt credited petitioner\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s explanation as to\nwhy they did not move to suppress\u2014that parts of the inter-\nview would support petitioner\u2019s trial strategy of claiming\nself-defense, and that they did not have a basis to move\nto suppress the statements that petitioner made before he\nclearly invoked his Miranda rights. On this record, as the\npost-conviction court correctly concluded, neither of those\nassessments represents a failure to exercise reasonable pro-\nfessional skill and judgment.\n          It was not unreasonable for petitioner\u2019s trial coun-\nsel to think that the statements could buttress petition-\ner\u2019s self-defense strategy. Trial counsel reasoned that one\nof petitioner\u2019s statements in the interview\u2014\u201dthey go on\nme\u201d\u2014was consistent with his claim of self-defense and was\nimportant because of its timing. Because petitioner made it\nto the police soon after the shooting, it could demonstrate\nthat petitioner had not changed his story after the fact.\n          It also was not unreasonable for petitioner\u2019s trial\ncounsel to think that a motion to suppress would not have\nsucceeded. Although petitioner contends that reasonable\ncounsel would have argued that petitioner\u2019s statement that\n\u201cI don\u2019t know nothin\u2019 about nothin\u2019 \u201d was an invocation of his\nMiranda right to remain silent, on its face, the statement is\na disclaimer of knowledge that does not state or imply that\npetitioner did not want to talk to police. It therefore stands\nin stark contrast with the statements that the Supreme\nCourt and we have deemed to be unequivocal or equivocal\ninvocations of the Miranda right to remain silent, which\ncontain some reference to speaking. See State v. Nichols,\n361 Or 101, 104, 107, 390 P3d 1001 (2017) (concluding that\n\u201cit\u2019s not something I want to talk about\u201d was an unequivo-\ncal invocation of the right to remain silent); State v. Rose,\n296 Or App 99, 102, 108, 437 P3d 1144 (2019) (concluding\nthat \u201cI don\u2019t have nothing to say\u201d was an equivocal invo-\ncation). Given that contrast, petitioners\u2019 trial counsel rea-\nsonably could conclude that petitioner\u2019s statement, \u201cI don\u2019t\n\f154                                      Richardson v. Cain\n\nknow nothin\u2019 about nothin\u2019,\u201d would not support a motion to\nsuppress premised on the theory that the statement invoked\npetitioner\u2019s Miranda rights and reasonably decline to pur-\nsue such a motion.\n         Failure to Seek Exclusion of Evidence That the Gun\nWas Stolen. In his first pro se supplemental assignment,\npetitioner contends that trial counsel were inadequate and\nineffective for not moving in limine to exclude evidence that\nthe gun that petitioner used to shoot the victims was stolen.\nThe post-conviction court denied relief on this claim for a\nrange of reasons, including that petitioner did not demon-\nstrate that the inclusion of the evidence prejudiced him:\n\u201cPetitioner did not prove that the introduction of evidence\nthat [p]etitioner had stolen the gun used in the shooting\ncould have had a tendency to affect the outcome of the trial.\u201d\nOn review of the record, we agree with that conclusion.\nGiven the evidence of petitioner\u2019s conduct, and the minimal\nemphasis placed on how petitioner acquired the gun, it is\nunlikely that the evidence had any tendency to affect the\njury\u2019s decision.\n         Failure to Call Memory Expert. In his second pro\nse supplemental assignment, petitioner contends that his\ntrial counsel were inadequate and ineffective for not calling\na memory expert as a witness at trial to explain petition-\ner\u2019s trial testimony that he did not remember pulling out\nhis gun, pulling the trigger, or shooting anyone. The post-\nconviction court denied relief on this claim based on its fac-\ntual findings that petitioner had not told his attorneys that\nhe did not remember his conduct, and, on multiple occasions,\ngave detailed descriptions of the events leading to the shoot-\nings. This led the post-conviction court to the conclusion\nthat trial counsel had no reason to foresee the need for a\nmemory expert. Those findings are supported by the record\nand preclude the conclusion that counsel\u2019s omission to call a\nmemory expert represents a failure to exercise reasonable\nprofessional skill and judgment. Green, 357 Or at 312 (sup-\nported findings of fact binding on appellate court). Absent\nevidence that petitioner had memory issues as counsel pre-\npared for trial, there was no reason for counsel to consult a\nmemory expert.\n\fNonprecedential Memo Op: 339 Or App 151 (2025)             155\n\n         Failure to Call Self-Defense Expert. In his third pro\nse supplemental assignment, petitioner assigns error to the\npost-conviction court\u2019s denial of relief on his claim that coun-\nsel were inadequate and ineffective for not calling as a wit-\nness Bedard, an expert they had hired to support petition-\ner\u2019s claim of self-defense. Counsel hired Bedard to observe\npetitioner\u2019s testimony at trial and then provide expert tes-\ntimony as to how it was consistent with self-defense. After\npetitioner testified at trial that he did not remember pulling\nthe trigger or shooting people, the trial court imposed sig-\nnificant limitations on Bedard\u2019s potential testimony, includ-\ning prohibiting him from opining on self-defense or on peti-\ntioner\u2019s response to the situation he was in. It was under\nthose circumstances that counsel decided not to call Bedard\nand so trial counsels\u2019 decision was a reasonable one because,\ngiven the trial court\u2019s limitations, the testimony would have\ndone little, if anything, to advance the defense.\n        Petitioner also contends that trial counsel failed to\nproperly prepare Bedard for trial. But as the superintendent\npoints out, that particular claim is not preserved. Beyond\nthat, we note that it is not clear what counsel could have\ndone to prepare Bedard for trial, given the substantial and\nunanticipated change in petitioner\u2019s story once he took the\nstand.\n         Failure to Adequately Advise Petitioner. In his\nfourth pro se supplemental assignment, petitioner assigns\nerror the post-conviction court\u2019s denial of relief on his claim\nthat trial counsel were inadequate and ineffective in advis-\ning him regarding the possibility of the death penalty and\npotential issues of appeal. Petitioner asserts that counsels\u2019\ninadequate advice prejudiced him by causing him to waive\nhis right to appeal and stipulate to a sentence of life without\nparole, when he otherwise would not have agreed to stipu-\nlate.

In his first\nassignment of error, which is the only assignment of error\nasserted in the brief filed by counsel, petitioner contends\n\fNonprecedential Memo Op: </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">339 Or App 151</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2025)           153\n\nthat the post-conviction court erred by denying relief on his\nclaim that his trial counsel were inadequate and ineffective\nfor not moving to suppress statements that he made in a\npost-arrest interview. In denying relief, the post-conviction\ncourt credited petitioner\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s explanation as to\nwhy they did not move to suppress\u2014that parts of the inter-\nview would support petitioner\u2019s trial strategy of claiming\nself-defense, and that they did not have a basis to move\nto suppress the statements that petitioner made before he\nclearly invoked his Miranda rights. On this record, as the\npost-conviction court correctly concluded, neither of those\nassessments represents a failure to exercise reasonable pro-\nfessional skill and judgment.\n          It was not unreasonable for petitioner\u2019s trial coun-\nsel to think that the statements could buttress petition-\ner\u2019s self-defense strategy. Trial counsel reasoned that one\nof petitioner\u2019s statements in the interview\u2014\u201dthey go on\nme\u201d\u2014was consistent with his claim of self-defense and was\nimportant because of its timing. Because petitioner made it\nto the police soon after the shooting, it could demonstrate\nthat petitioner had not changed his story after the fact.\n          It also was not unreasonable for petitioner\u2019s trial\ncounsel to think that a motion to suppress would not have\nsucceeded. Although petitioner contends that reasonable\ncounsel would have argued that petitioner\u2019s statement that\n\u201cI don\u2019t know nothin\u2019 about nothin\u2019 \u201d was an invocation of his\nMiranda right to remain silent, on its face, the statement is\na disclaimer of knowledge that does not state or imply that\npetitioner did not want to talk to police. It therefore stands\nin stark contrast with the statements that the Supreme\nCourt and we have deemed to be unequivocal or equivocal\ninvocations of the Miranda right to remain silent, which\ncontain some reference to speaking.

Given that contrast, petitioners\u2019 trial counsel rea-\nsonably could conclude that petitioner\u2019s statement, \u201cI don\u2019t\n\f154                                      Richardson v. Cain\n\nknow nothin\u2019 about nothin\u2019,\u201d would not support a motion to\nsuppress premised on the theory that the statement invoked\npetitioner\u2019s Miranda rights and reasonably decline to pur-\nsue such a motion.\n         Failure to Seek Exclusion of Evidence That the Gun\nWas Stolen. In his first pro se supplemental assignment,\npetitioner contends that trial counsel were inadequate and\nineffective for not moving in limine to exclude evidence that\nthe gun that petitioner used to shoot the victims was stolen.\nThe post-conviction court denied relief on this claim for a\nrange of reasons, including that petitioner did not demon-\nstrate that the inclusion of the evidence prejudiced him:\n\u201cPetitioner did not prove that the introduction of evidence\nthat [p]etitioner had stolen the gun used in the shooting\ncould have had a tendency to affect the outcome of the trial.\u201d\nOn review of the record, we agree with that conclusion.\nGiven the evidence of petitioner\u2019s conduct, and the minimal\nemphasis placed on how petitioner acquired the gun, it is\nunlikely that the evidence had any tendency to affect the\njury\u2019s decision.\n         Failure to Call Memory Expert. In his second pro\nse supplemental assignment, petitioner contends that his\ntrial counsel were inadequate and ineffective for not calling\na memory expert as a witness at trial to explain petition-\ner\u2019s trial testimony that he did not remember pulling out\nhis gun, pulling the trigger, or shooting anyone. The post-\nconviction court denied relief on this claim based on its fac-\ntual findings that petitioner had not told his attorneys that\nhe did not remember his conduct, and, on multiple occasions,\ngave detailed descriptions of the events leading to the shoot-\nings. This led the post-conviction court to the conclusion\nthat trial counsel had no reason to foresee the need for a\nmemory expert. Those findings are supported by the record\nand preclude the conclusion that counsel\u2019s omission to call a\nmemory expert represents a failure to exercise reasonable\nprofessional skill and judgment.

In his third pro\nse supplemental assignment, petitioner assigns error to the\npost-conviction court\u2019s denial of relief on his claim that coun-\nsel were inadequate and ineffective for not calling as a wit-\nness Bedard, an expert they had hired to support petition-\ner\u2019s claim of self-defense. Counsel hired Bedard to observe\npetitioner\u2019s testimony at trial and then provide expert tes-\ntimony as to how it was consistent with self-defense. After\npetitioner testified at trial that he did not remember pulling\nthe trigger or shooting people, the trial court imposed sig-\nnificant limitations on Bedard\u2019s potential testimony, includ-\ning prohibiting him from opining on self-defense or on peti-\ntioner\u2019s response to the situation he was in. It was under\nthose circumstances that counsel decided not to call Bedard\nand so trial counsels\u2019 decision was a reasonable one because,\ngiven the trial court\u2019s limitations, the testimony would have\ndone little, if anything, to advance the defense.\n        Petitioner also contends that trial counsel failed to\nproperly prepare Bedard for trial. But as the superintendent\npoints out, that particular claim is not preserved. Beyond\nthat, we note that it is not clear what counsel could have\ndone to prepare Bedard for trial, given the substantial and\nunanticipated change in petitioner\u2019s story once he took the\nstand.\n         Failure to Adequately Advise Petitioner. In his\nfourth pro se supplemental assignment, petitioner assigns\nerror the post-conviction court\u2019s denial of relief on his claim\nthat trial counsel were inadequate and ineffective in advis-\ning him regarding the possibility of the death penalty and\npotential issues of appeal. Petitioner asserts that counsels\u2019\ninadequate advice prejudiced him by causing him to waive\nhis right to appeal and stipulate to a sentence of life without\nparole, when he otherwise would not have agreed to stipu-\nlate. The post-conviction court denied relief on this claim,\nexplaining its reasoning in detail, and finding that peti-\ntioner was advised extensively on the \u201cpluses and minuses\nof the resolution and the effect of waiving appeal.\u201d The post-\nconviction court further found that \u201cThere were no sure-fire\nissues on appeal and [p]etitioner was advised of his chances\non appeal.\u201d\n\f156                                       Richardson v. Cain\n\n         In challenging that ruling on appeal, petitioner\ndoes not dispute the post-conviction court\u2019s factual find-\nings, meaningfully engage with its reasoning, or point to\nany evidence in the record that would compel the court to\nconclude that petitioner met the burden of demonstrating\nthat the advice he received was mistaken or unreasonable.\nHowever, petitioner identifies three issues that he claims\n\u201ccould have been raised on direct appeal\u201d: a Batson issue; a\nmistrial issue; and an issue regarding the limitations that\nthe trial court placed on Bedard\u2019s potential testimony.

J.\n         Youth appeals a juvenile court order requiring him\nto report as a sex offender. He assigns error to the order\nitself and argues that the court applied an erroneous legal\nstandard in assessing whether he met his burden to prove\n\u201cby clear and convincing evidence that [he] is rehabilitated\nand does not pose a threat to the safety of the public,\u201d ORS\n163A.030(7)(b), because the court did not focus on youth\u2019s\ncurrent risk of sexual recidivism. Additionally, youth assigns\nerror to the court\u2019s exclusion of (1) an article about juvenile\nsexual recidivism (the Caldwell article1), (2) an article about\nthe effectiveness of specialized treatment programs for\njuvenile sex offenders (the Kettrey article2), and (3) youth\u2019s\noriginal treatment notebook. Youth argues that his expert\nrelied upon the research articles in her direct and rebuttal\ntestimony and that they were, thus, relevant to her credibil-\nity and conclusions. He argues that the original notebook\nwas relevant because it would allow him to rebut allegations\nthat he had forged certain initials in the notebook and that\nhe provided incomplete copies of the notebook to his benefit.\nAccording to youth, exclusion of the relevant exhibits was\nreversible error.\n         The state does not dispute that the excluded exhib-\nits are relevant. It argues instead that the exhibits were\nproperly excluded as a discretionary sanction for discovery\nviolations. Youth argues that the juvenile court abused its\ndiscretion when it excluded the exhibits because, under ORS\n163A.030(9), the statutory hearing is designed to allow the\njuvenile court to \u201creceive testimony, reports and other evi-\ndence, without regard to whether the evidence is admissible\nunder\u201d the rules of evidence if it is \u201crelated to the determi-\nnation and findings required under\u201d ORS 163A.030.\n        We conclude, for the reasons that follow, that the\nCaldwell and Kettrey articles, and the original treatment\nnotebook, were relevant to the issues before the juvenile\n\n   1\n      Michael F.

With respect to the merits of the court\u2019s decision\nordering youth to report as a sex offender, we conclude that\nthe record did not require it to answer the factual ques-\ntion under ORS 163A.030 in a different way. We, therefore,\naffirm.\n         Youth asks us to conduct de novo review. ORS\n19.415(3)(b) permits us, in our \u201csole discretion,\u201d to \u201ctry the\ncause anew upon the record or [to] make one or more factual\nfindings anew upon the record.\u201d ORAP 5.40(8) describes the\nprocess by which de novo review may be requested, and it\nprovides a nonexclusive and nonbinding list of items that\nwe consider relevant to the decision whether to exercise our\ndiscretion to conduct de novo review, emphasizing that we\nexercise our discretion to conduct de novo review only in\n\u201cexceptional cases.\u201d\n         We recently exercised our discretion to review the\nrecord de novo in two appeals of orders requiring sex offender\nreporting: State v. X. E. W., 331 Or App 1, 2, 546 P3d 288\n(2024) (exercising authority to review the record de novo \u201cin\norder to apply the legal principles outlined in State v. A. R.\nH., 371 Or 82, 530 P3d 897 (2023), which the Supreme Court\nissued after the parties submitted their briefs in this case\u201d)\nand State v. K. L. F., 333 Or App 434, 435, 552 P3d 722\n(2024) (exercising authority to review the record de novo, \u201c[a]\ns we recently did\u201d in X. E. W. because \u201cthe juvenile court\napplied an incorrect standard when assessing youth\u2019s risk\nof recidivism\u201d). This case is similar to both X. E. W. and K.\nL. F. in that the juvenile court ruled on youth\u2019s petition for\nrelief from sex offender requirements before A. R. H. was\npublished. However, this case does not present the same\nconcerns that were present in X. E. W. and K. L. F. about\nthe trial court\u2019s application of the correct legal framework.\nConsequently, we do not exercise our discretion to review\nthis case de novo.\n        We conduct our review of the juvenile court\u2019s order\nrequiring youth to report as a sex offender in accordance\nwith the usual standard of appellate review, recogniz-\ning that the juvenile court\u2019s assigned inquiry under ORS\n\fCite as 339 Or App 134 (2025)                                              137\n\n163A.030(7)(b) is \u201ca factual inquiry.\u201d A. R.

We\nreview the juvenile court\u2019s exclusion of relevant evidence as\nduplicative for abuse of discretion. See State v. Titus, 328 Or\n475, 481, 982 P2d 1133 (1999) (\u201cA decision to exclude evi-\ndence under OEC 403 is reserved to the trial court\u2019s discre-\ntion.\u201d). We conduct our review of the juvenile court\u2019s eviden-\ntiary rulings \u201cin light of the record that was before the court\nat the time of its ruling.\u201d State v. Rodriguez-Delao, 335 Or\nApp 700, 701, 560 P3d 85 (2024).\n         We turn to the pertinent underlying historical\nand procedural facts. The state filed a delinquency petition\nagainst youth, then 16 years of age, alleging that when he\nwas between the ages of 13 and 15, he had engaged in con-\nduct with two younger cousins and a half-sister that, if done\nby an adult, would constitute eight felony sex crimes. The\njuvenile court accepted \u201cAlford pleas\u201d from youth on Counts\n1 and 6, and an admission on Count 7.3 It then determined\n     3\n       Counts 1, 6, and 7 of the amended delinquency petition charged youth as\nfollows:\n     \u201cCount 1 Rape in the First Degree (ORS 163.375) (Class A Felony) The said\n     youth, on, about, or between June 30th, 2015 to June 30th, 2017, in Yamhill\n     County, Oregon, did unlawfully and knowingly engage in sexual intercourse\n     with B.H.P., a child under twelve years of age, said act of youth being con-\n     trary to the statutes in such cases made and provided and against the peace\n     and dignity of the State of Oregon.\n     \u201c* * * * *\n     \u201cCount 6 Attempted Sexual Abuse in the First Degree (ORS 161.405) (ORS\n     163.427) (Class C Felony) The said youth, on, about, or between June 30th,\n\f138                                                          State v. B. J. P.\n\nthat youth was within the delinquency jurisdiction of the\njuvenile court.4\n         An Alford plea is a reference to North Carolina v.\nAlford, 400 US 25, 91 S Ct 160, 27 L Ed 2d 162 (1970). It\nis equivalent to a \u201cno contest\u201d plea under ORS 135.335(1)\n(c). Commentary to Criminal Law Revision Commission\nProposed Oregon Criminal Procedure Code, Final Draft\nand Report \u00a7 252, 149 (Nov 1972). As we recently explained:\n    \u201c \u2018An Alford plea is a guilty plea in which the defendant does\n    not admit commission of the criminal act or asserts that he\n    is innocent.\u2019 State v. Sullivan, 197 Or App 26, 28 n 1, 104\n    P3d 636 (2005), rev den, 340 Or 673 (2006) (concluding that\n    it was not plain error for a trial court to rely on an Alford\n    plea as an admission of facts justifying a sentence enhance-\n    ment). With an Alford plea, a defendant does not admit\n    guilt \u2018but admits that sufficient evidence exists to convict\n    him of the offense.\u2019 United States v. Ramirez-Gonzalez, 755\n    F3d 1267, 1273 (11th Cir 2014).\n        \u201cBefore entering a judgment of conviction from a plea\n    of guilty or no contest, the trial court must \u2018mak[e] such\n    inquiry as may satisfy the court that there is a factual basis\n    for the plea.\u2019 ORS 135.395. The \u2018\u201dfactual basis for the plea\u201d\n    refers to facts concerning the defendant\u2019s guilt\u2014i.e., facts\n    regarding whether the defendant committed the crime to\n    which the defendant is pleading.\u2019 State v. Heisser, 232 Or\n    App 320, 329, 222 P3d 719 (2009).\u201d\nState v. Jackson, 319 Or App 789, 791, 511 P3d 82 (2022). In\nproceeding with Alford pleas, youth chose not to contest that\n    2015 to June 30th, 2017, in Yamhill County, Oregon, did unlawfully and\n    intentionally attempt by forcible compulsion to subject T.T., a child under\n    fourteen years of age, to sexual contact, to wit: causing T.T. to touch said\n    youth\u2019s penis, a sexual or intimate part of said youth, said act of youth being\n    contrary to the statutes in such cases made and provided and against the\n    peace and dignity of the State of Oregon.\n        \u201cCount 7 Attempted Sexual Abuse in the First Degree (ORS 161.405)\n        (ORS 163.427) (Class C Felony) The said youth, on, about, or between\n        October 31st, 2015 to October 31st, 2017, in Yamhill County, Oregon,\n        did unlawfully and intentionally attempt to subject G.C., a child under\n        fourteen years of age, to sexual contact, to wit: touching G.C.\u2019s breasts,\n        a sexual or intimate part of G.C., said act of youth being contrary to the\n        statutes in such cases made and provided and against the peace and\n        dignity of the State of Oregon.\u201d\n    4\n      Counts 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 were dismissed by the juvenile court at the time of\njurisdiction.\n\fCite as 339 Or App 134 (2025)                            139\n\nhe engaged in intercourse with his 6-year-old half-sister and\nthat he attempted to forcibly compel his 12-year-old cousin\nto touch his penis. We necessarily presume that the juvenile\ncourt determined that there was a factual basis for those\ncharges when it took youth\u2019s Alford pleas.\n         The juvenile court placed youth on probation for\nfive years with conditions that required him to, among other\nthings, obey all laws, abstain from using or possessing con-\ntrolled substances and alcohol, enter and complete sex-\noffender treatment, and not have contact with minor children.\n         Youth began treatment specifically designed for\njuvenile sexual offenders and he was \u201cpretty solid\u201d in that\nprogram for the first eighteen months. By all accounts,\nyouth was \u201cengaged\u201d in all aspects of his probation, includ-\ning treatment, during that initial time period. But youth\u2019s\nengagement with treatment fell off after he left his grand-\nmother\u2019s home at age 18. He often missed scheduled ther-\napy appointments and meetings with his probation officer.\nYouth submitted to various polygraph examinations, but\nthe results were generally inconclusive, and at one point, he\ntested positive for marijuana and methamphetamine. Youth\ndid not complete sex offender treatment. Consequently, the\ncourt found youth to be in violation of probation. It revoked\nhis probation, sanctioned him with \u201ctime served,\u201d and effec-\ntively ended his period of supervision.\n        Youth sought relief from reporting as a sex offender\npursuant to ORS 163A.030. The hearing began before\none judge in June 2022, but it was discontinued and reset\nto begin before a second judge who conducted the hear-\ning over the course of several days beginning in October\n2022 and concluding in January 2023. Witnesses included\nyouth, Dr. Crossen (licensed psychologist who completed an\nupdated psychosexual evaluation concerning youth), Sean\nClark (youth\u2019s therapist), and Rebecca Newmann (youth\u2019s\nprobation officer).\n        Youth testified that he did not complete treatment,\nand he acknowledged that his failure to complete treatment\nresulted in the revocation of his probation. He testified that\nhe had been given a chance to \u201cre-enroll in [treatment]\n\f140                                             State v. B. J. P.\n\nservices\u201d but that he opted not to do so. Youth identified a\nset of photographs that he took of treatment workbook pages\nthat he kept in a binder. He testified that the handwriting\non those pages included that of his therapist, Clark, his\nprobation officer, Newmann, his dad, and his own \u201cchicken\nscratch.\u201d Clark or Newmann would initial the pages as\nyouth completed the work. He testified that the treatment\nchecklist at the back of the binder contained initials on all\nbut the three items that he did not complete: \u201ccomplete all of\nthe assignments,\u201d \u201ccomplete victim awareness assignment,\u201d\nand \u201ccomplete clarification/apology letter.\u201d Youth testified\nthat he did not write any letters to the victims. In partic-\nular, he testified that because he gave Alford pleas on two\nof the counts, a letter of apology or clarification would not\n\u201chave fit [his] specific needs.\u201d He also did not send a letter to\nthe victim in the count that he admitted.\n        Dr. Crossen testified that she completed youth\u2019s\n\u201cupdated psychosexual evaluation.\u201d Her report was received\nin evidence. The 30-page report details Crossen\u2019s findings\nand conclusions, and she testified about those findings at\nthe hearing. In particular, Crossen concluded,\n   \u201cOverall, [youth\u2019s] current estimate of sex offense recidi-\n   vism is low, and therefore the public would not be offered\n   any additional protection by requiring [youth] to register\n   as a sex offender.\u201d\nCrossen offered her opinion that although youth did not com-\nplete his treatment program, he \u201chas a low need for interven-\ntions at this time.\u201d Indeed, Crossen testified that the sexual\nrecidivism rate for juveniles is very low and that \u201cthe risk\nof re-offending is within the first three years after getting\ncaught.\u201d Crossen testified that various studies address juve-\nnile sexual recidivism rates, and that the Caldwell article\nin particular places that rate at 2.75 percent. Youth rested\nafter Crossen\u2019s testimony, and the hearing was continued to\na date approximately one month later.\n         When the hearing continued the next month, youth\noffered the Caldwell article into evidence. The state objected\nbecause youth had rested the month before and had not\ngiven it a copy of the article until the morning it was offered,\n\fCite as 339 Or App 134 (2025)                                    141\n\njust as the state was about to present its evidence. The court\nruled as follows:\n       \u201cIt gets more awkward when we go into these non\u2014\n   these hearings without evidentiary rules, though, when the\n   evidence code doesn\u2019t apply, it\u2019s harder\u2014it\u2019s harder because\n   most of this stuff needs to come in. But I really don\u2019t want\n   to come back in 2025 and still be litigating this case, so the\n   study itself is not going to come in except for purposes of an\n   offer of proof, if we can keep the testimony about what this\n   study says to ten to fifteen minutes, I will allow it. However,\n   beyond\u2014and I\u2019m allowing it in part because I don\u2019t know\n   that it\u2019s going to make a huge difference to the outcome of\n   this case. Beyond that, though, [youth\u2019s counsel], if this is\n   going to be, you know, an hour worth of testimony on this\n   new issue, I don\u2019t think I can go there because I really don\u2019t\n   want to be still here in three years.\u201d\n         The state then called its witnesses, Clark and\nNewmann. Newmann testified that, other than the conduct\nto which youth admitted at the time of jurisdiction, she was\n\u201caware of no hands-on sexual offenses by [youth].\u201d She fur-\nther testified that youth struggled with the \u201caccountability\u201d\npart of the treatment program, at least in part, because\nhe had not admitted to the underlying conduct. Clark and\nNewmann both confirmed that youth had not completed\ntreatment and that, because of that, his probation had been\nrevoked.\n        The parties agree that the purpose of the hearing\nin question was to determine whether youth, who had been\nadjudicated for felony sex crimes as a juvenile offender,\nwould be required to report as a sex offender under ORS\n163A.030. ORS 163A.030(1) provides, as pertinent:\n   \u201c[T]he juvenile court shall hold a hearing on the issue of\n   reporting as a sex offender by a person who has been found\n   to be within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court under ORS\n   419C.005 * * * for having committed an act that if commit-\n   ted by an adult would constitute a felony sex crime[.]\u201d\nThe statute describes the various procedural and eviden-\ntiary requirements for such hearings and, in particular,\nORS 163A.030(7)(b) describes the burden of proof as follows:\n\f142                                                State v. B. J. P.\n\n      \u201cThe person who is the subject of the hearing has the\n   burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that\n   the person is rehabilitated and does not pose a threat to the\n   safety of the public. If the court finds that the person has\n   not met the burden of proof, the court shall enter an order\n   requiring the person to report as a sex offender under ORS\n   163A.025.\u201d\nAs the Supreme Court explained,\n   \u201cwhether a youth must report as a sex offender under ORS\n   163A.030 depends on a factual inquiry. The youth bears\n   the burden to prove that it is highly probable that they\n   have undergone a process of rehabilitation and do not pres-\n   ent a risk of committing future sex offenses. * * * [T]he juve-\n   nile court may order the youth to report as a sex offender\n   only when it finds that those asserted facts are not highly\n   probable.\u201d\nA. R. H., 371 Or at 95. \u201c[A] youth\u2019s pre-adjudication conduct\nalone will not necessarily permit a finding that the youth\nhas failed to prove * * * that the youth is rehabilitated and\nnot a threat to the safety of the public.\u201d Id. at 88.\n       ORS 163A.030(9) establishes relevance as the\nstandard for admitting evidence in hearings to determine\nwhether a youth must report as a sex offender:\n   \u201c* * * [T]he juvenile court may receive testimony, reports\n   and other evidence, without regard to whether the evidence\n   is admissible under [OEC 100] to [OEC 412] and [OEC 601]\n   to [OEC 1008], if the evidence is relevant evidence related\n   to the determination and findings required under this sec-\n   tion. As used in this subsection, \u2018relevant evidence\u2019 has the\n   meaning given that term in [OEC 401].\u201d\nThat relatively low evidentiary bar is consistent with the\nprocedural flexibility built into delinquency hearings, and\nthe well-settled principles that juvenile proceedings are not\ncriminal trials, State v. R. J. S., 318 Or App 351, 354, 506\nP3d 1151, rev den, 370 Or 211 (2022), and delinquency adju-\ndications are not criminal convictions, ORS 419C.400(5).\nImportantly, though, ORS 163A.030(9) describes what the\njuvenile court \u201cmay\u201d receive; it does not describe what must\nbe received.\n\fCite as 339 Or App 134 (2025)                             143\n\n         As an initial matter, to the extent that youth argues\non appeal that he had no discovery obligation to disclose the\nexhibits at issue before the start of the hearing, that argu-\nment is not preserved, and it is not plain or obvious that it\nis correct. We assume, for current purposes, that a hear-\ning under ORS 163A.030 to determine whether an adjudi-\ncated youth must report as a sex offender is a stage in a\nproceeding within the juvenile court\u2019s exclusive delinquency\njurisdiction under ORS 419C.005. That means that ORS\n419C.270 applies to the proceeding except to the extent the\nspecific provisions of ORS 163A.030 indicate otherwise. And\nwhile ORS 163A.030(9) makes many of the provisions of the\nOregon Evidence Code inapplicable to those hearings, cer-\ntain criminal procedures nevertheless apply in delinquency\nproceedings, and ORS 163A.030 does not speak to the issue\nof discovery but ORS 419C.270 does. Among other things,\nORS 419C.270(6) applies ORS 135.835, ORS 135.845, and\nORS 135.865 to delinquency proceedings.\n         ORS 135.835(3) requires the defendant to \u201cdisclose\nto\u201d the prosecuting attorney \u201c[a]ny books, papers, docu-\nments, photographs or tangible objects that the defense\nintends to offer in evidence at the trial\u201d that are \u201cwithin the\npossession or control of the defense.\u201d ORS 135.845 makes\nthose obligations of disclosure time sensitive, requiring that\ndisclosure occur \u201cas soon as practicable following the filing\u201d\nof the charging instrument, and subjecting the parties to\nongoing duties of disclosure for additional materials that\n\u201ca party finds, either before or during trial[.]\u201d ORS 135.865\nprovides the trial court with sanctions that it may impose\nfor discovery violations including ordering \u201cthe violating\nparty to permit inspection of the material, or grant[ing] a\ncontinuance, or refus[ing] to permit the witness to testify,\nor refus[ing] to receive in evidence the material not dis-\nclosed, or enter[ing] such other order as it considers appro-\npriate.\u201d Thus, because youth did not preserve the issue and\nbecause, as we have explained, it is not obvious that youth\nis correct that no statutory discovery obligations apply in a\nhearing under ORS 163A.030, we assume, without decid-\ning, that ORS 419C.270(6), which governs discovery obliga-\ntions in delinquency cases, applies to hearings under ORS\n163A.030, which does not address discovery obligations,\n\f144                                                          State v. B. J. P.\n\nbecause doing so allows us to give effect to both statutes.5\nSee Powers v. Quigley, 345 Or 432, 438, 198 P3d 919 (2008)\n(\u201c[I]f the court can give full effect to both statutes, it will do\nso, and if not, it will treat the specific statute as an exception\nto the general.\u201d).\n         Youth argues that the Caldwell article, Exhibit\n110, was relevant to the key issues of his rehabilitation\nand whether he poses a threat to the safety of the public.\n\u201cThe crux\u201d of the Caldwell article, according to youth, was\nthat it identified the rate of sexual recidivism in individu-\nals like youth. The article is clearly relevant, but the state\ndoes not dispute that, and the juvenile court did not exclude\nthe Caldwell article on relevance grounds. It ultimately\nexcluded the article after this discussion with counsel:\n        \u201c[PROSECUTOR]: So, Your Honor, this was just pro-\n    vided to me this morning, the testimony was last month, I\n    haven\u2019t had a chance to read it, Dr. Crossen testified about\n    it, given that it\u2019s essentially late discovery, there was tes-\n    timony from the Defense expert in relation to that, I would\n    object to just the study being entered into the record due to\n    the discovery I guess late violation as well as Dr. Crossen\u2019s\n    already testified to what she wanted in relation to that and\n    the State would not have time to prepare or to look at any\n    contradicting studies or be able to have a conversation with\n    anybody related to that study.\n        \u201cTHE COURT: [Counsel for youth]?\n       \u201c[YOUTH\u2019S COUNSEL]:           * * * [C]ounsel[ ] had the\n    opportunity to cross-examine Dr. Crossen, also this study\n    she referred to * * * has to do with the very decision that\n    Your Honor is making, which is the recidivism rate gen-\n    erally and then the fact that my client fits within that\n    category of adolescents, so I would think that under the\n\n    5\n      We acknowledge that ORS 135.835 and ORS 135.845 refer to \u201cthe fil-\ning of an indictment or information,\u201d \u201cthe defense,\u201d and \u201cthe trial.\u201d But ORS\n419C.270(6) makes those provisions applicable to delinquency proceedings under\nORS 419C.005, and given that, we assume that those terms must be read to make\nsense in that context as references, respectively, to delinquency petitions, youth,\nand fact-finding hearings. We likewise read those provisions to make sense in\nthe context of delinquency hearings under ORS 163A.030 as references to peti-\ntions for relief from reporting requirements, youth, and the fact-finding hearing\nrequired by ORS 163A.030. As noted, youth did not preserve any argument that\nthere is no statutory discovery process that applies to ORS 163A.030 hearings.\nThat issue is not before us and we do not decide it.\n\fCite as 339 Or App 134 (2025)                                 145\n\n  very loose rule of evidence in a disposition-type hearing in\n  juvenile that anything that would be useful to the Court to\n  have these * * * would certainly fall within that category of\n  relevance.\n     \u201cTHE COURT: I\u2019m going to go ahead and receive the\n  exhibit, but if you want to cross-examine Dr. Crossen addi-\n  tionally, [prosecutor], if you want some additional time\u2014\n      \u201c[PROSECUTOR]: And so Your Honor is essentially\n  saying, hey, you know, we\u2019re\u2014this is day five of this hear-\n  ing, Dr. Crossen at the first hearing testified to that study,\n  it wasn\u2019t provided to the State, so now we\u2019re here on month\n  11, I think, and we\u2019re getting brand new discovery from the\n  Defense, so I can\u2019t possibly make a decision of potentially\n  need[ing] more time when we have victims who have been\n  waiting for this determination as well as I\u2019m sure [youth]\n  as well and we\u2019re getting new stuff from the Defense, which\n  is the State like\u2014\n     \u201cTHE COURT: Why wasn\u2019t it given to [the prosecutor]\n  earlier?\n      \u201c[YOUTH\u2019S COUNSEL]: I just, I asked Dr. Crossen for\n  it because she talked about it repeatedly because I wanted\n  to read it, so I looked at it and I thought it would be use-\n  ful, I just didn\u2019t prepare it for today, so it\u2019s not something\n  that, you know, I thought about other than, as I said, I\u2019m\n  just saying I think it\u2019s highly relevant to the decision Your\n  Honor\u2019s making, it\u2019s just, you know, it is being provided to\n  the Court today, so\u2014\n     \u201c[PROSECUTOR]: And so, Your Honor, that study is\n  referenced in Dr. Crossen\u2019s report from I believe April, so\n  that\u2019s when [youth\u2019s counsel] would have learned of it and\n  would have had the opportunity to do that, we were here in\n  June, we talked about it then, I just, I think it\u2019s manifestly\n  unfair to the State to come in on this\u2014on a bifurcated\n  hearing to have, hey, here\u2019s new information that you pre-\n  viously didn\u2019t have that I\u2019m going to submit as an exhibit\n  without giving you the opportunity to review or be able to\n  address it in any capacity. There I have to feel like there\n  has to be some limit on\u2014\n     \u201cTHE COURT: Yeah, and you\u2019re right\u2014\n     \u201c[PROSECUTOR]: \u2014on when the Defense and just\n  history on this case, Your Honor, when we were in front of\n\f146                                              State v. B. J. P.\n\n   [a different judge], on day two of that hearing the Defense\n   provided the State with what has been admitted as treat-\n   ment notes, so this is something that\u2019s been habitual in\n   this case, I\u2019m afraid if we set this over again the Defense\n   will provide additional exhibits and additional materials\n   every single time we come back\u2014\n      \u201cTHE COURT: The last thing I want to do is set this\n   over again, I will not, I will change my mind on that, I will\n   not receive the exhibit[.]\u201d\nThe parties characterize the trial court\u2019s decision to exclude\nthe Caldwell article as a discovery sanction, but they dis-\nagree about whether it was a proper exercise of the court\u2019s\ndiscretion.\n         We agree that the juvenile court excluded the\nCaldwell article as a discovery violation sanction. As we\nalready explained, youth had an obligation to disclose any\ntangible exhibits that he planned to offer at the hearing,\nand that obligation was ongoing as to \u201cadditional material\nor information\u201d that he became aware of as the hearing pro-\nceeded. The obligation is time-sensitive, requiring prompt\nnotice of any new material. The disclosure obligation is trig-\ngered when a party can \u201creasonably predict\u201d that he will\nintroduce the evidence. See State v. Young, 94 Or App 683,\n689, 767 P2d 90 (1989).\n          Youth is correct that, under OEC 705, an expert may\ntestify to their opinion \u201cand give reasons therefor without\nprior disclosure of the underlying facts or data.\u201d However,\nand as happened here, \u201c[t]he expert may in any event be\nrequired to disclose the underlying facts or data on cross-\nexamination.\u201d OEC 705. Once youth became aware of the\nCaldwell article through Crossen\u2019s testimony and decided to\noffer it as an exhibit, he had a duty to promptly notify the\nstate of his intent to do so. Given that youth had finished\npresenting his case-in-chief and had rested without offering\nthe Caldwell article into evidence, it was not error for the\njuvenile court to conclude that he violated his ongoing dis-\ncovery obligation by not notifying the state that he intended\nto offer the article as an exhibit. Indeed, youth waited for\nthe state to begin presenting its evidence, a month later,\nand then offered the exhibit with no notice at all.\n\fCite as 339 Or App 134 (2025)                              147\n\n         The sanctions available to the juvenile court under\nORS 135.865 ranged from granting a continuance to exclud-\ning the Caldwell article. It is apparent that the court consid-\nered a continuance but determined that exclusion was more\nappropriate under the circumstances. We cannot say that\nthe court abused its discretion, especially given the length\nof time that had passed since youth filed his petition, and\nCrossen\u2019s extensive testimony about the Caldwell article.\n         Youth offered the Kettrey article, Exhibit 112, which\naddresses whether individuals like youth must complete\ntreatment to \u201cfall into the low recidivism category,\u201d during\nhis rebuttal case when he recalled Crossen. Again, the state\ndoes not dispute the relevance of the Kettrey article. After\nhearing from the parties, the juvenile court stated that if it\nwere to \u201ccontinue to receive new exhibits every single [day]\n* * * we will never get this hearing * * * done.\u201d The court\nlater clarified that it would allow Crossen to testify about\nwhether completing a treatment program impacts recidi-\nvism, but that the Kettrey article itself would be excluded.\nWe conclude that the juvenile court did not abuse its discre-\ntion in excluding the Kettrey article for the same reasons it\ndid not abuse its discretion in excluding the Caldwell article.\n         Youth offered a binder of the original workbook\npages from his sex offender treatment program as Exhibit\n111 when he presented his rebuttal case. But youth had,\nin his case-in-chief, already successfully offered Exhibit\n109, which consisted of photographs that he testified he\nhad taken of the pages in his treatment workbook that\nhe had kept in a binder. When questioned about Exhibit\n109 on cross-examination, youth testified that he thought\nExhibit 109 was a complete copy of his notebook but, when\npressed about that, he indicated that he was not certain. His\ntherapist, Clark, later testified that a treatment checklist\nincluded in youth\u2019s Exhibit 109 looked \u201codd\u201d to him because,\namong other reasons, it was \u201cpretty much completely signed\noff\u201d even though he would not typically sign off on such a list\nuntil the end of treatment, which youth did not complete.\n         Youth offered Exhibit 111 to rebut the suggestion\nthat he had \u201cforged\u201d the treatment checklist. In particu-\nlar, he offered Exhibit 111 as \u201crelevant for Your Honor to\n\f148                                              State v. B. J. P.\n\nsee some other original initialings also in the notebook\ndone by Mr. Clark.\u201d The primary focus of the state\u2019s cross-\nexamination of youth about Exhibit 109 was on the check-\nlist. The juvenile court separated the original checklist from\nthe proffered exhibit and received it as Exhibit 113, ruling:\n   \u201cI am going to receive the original of the treatment check-\n   list, I\u2019m not going to receive the originals of anything else\n   * * * that\u2019s duplicative.\u201d\nThe juvenile court, as trier of fact, heard the testimony of\nyouth and Clark concerning the treatment binder, and it\nhad received Exhibits 109 and 113, showing photographs\nof the workbook and the original treatment checklist.\nTherefore, the juvenile court received the original checklist\nthat was at issue during youth\u2019s cross-examination, permit-\nting it to assess the document\u2019s authenticity, and it other-\nwise excluded the portions of the notebook that were dupli-\ncative of the photographs provided in Exhibit 109. Even if,\nfor the purpose of argument only, it was error for the court\nto exclude the rest of Exhibit 111, the evidence excluded was\n\u201cmerely cumulative of admitted evidence\u201d and therefore, its\nexclusion was harmless. State v. Jasperse, 310 Or App 703,\n711, 487 P3d 402, rev den, 368 Or 787 (2021) (internal quo-\ntation marks omitted).\n        Turning, finally, to the juvenile court\u2019s conclusion\nthat youth failed to meet his burden under ORS 163A.030\nand that he must, therefore, report as a sex offender, the\ncourt explained its ruling from the bench as follows:\n       \u201cOn this record, the alleged acts, two of the counts of\n   which he took Alford pleas, one of the counts which he\n   admitted, they\u2019re fairly serious alleged offenses, we have\n   multiple victims, two of whom have significant age gap, at\n   least at the time, between themselves and [youth]. And on\n   this record I feel like I have more questions than answers.\n   I have questions about the youth\u2019s credibility, I have ques-\n   tions about what really happened to the victims, I have\n   questions about why the youth didn\u2019t complete treatment, I\n   have questions about why the youth didn\u2019t at least complete\n   the empathy assignments, the clarification assignments as\n   to the victim that he admitted, I have questions about why\n   the youth seems to minimize what happened even to the\n   victim that he acknowledges, I have questions about why\n\fCite as 339 Or App 134 (2025)                               149\n\n   the youth wasn\u2019t able to better articulate things that he\n   learned in treatment.\n      \u201cI think given those questions and I think given the\n   static factors, I think as [youth\u2019s counsel] has typically\n   described them in other cases, it does pain me, but I find\n   that the youth has not proven by clear and convincing evi-\n   dence that he is rehabilitated and does not pose a safety\n   threat to the public[.]\u201d\nIn its written order, the juvenile court found that \u201cyouth\nhas not proven, by clear and convincing evidence, that he or\nshe is rehabilitated and does not pose a safety threat to the\npublic.\u201d\n         We acknowledge that, when making its oral ruling,\nthe court stated its findings in terms of \u201cquestions\u201d that it\nhad about the nature of the underlying juvenile offenses,\nyouth\u2019s present day credibility, why youth continued to min-\nimize the effect of his offenses on the victims, why he did not\ncomplete treatment\u2014in particular his failure to complete\nthe empathy and clarification assignments\u2014and why youth\ncould not articulate what he had learned in treatment. By\nnoting the many questions it had at the conclusion of the\nhearing, we understand the juvenile court to have been\nexplaining the weaknesses it found in youth\u2019s case and con-\nnecting those weaknesses to youth\u2019s current risk of sexual\nrecidivism. In its explanation, the court relied on risk factors\nthat included youth\u2019s recent failure to complete treatment,\nwhich included, in part, his ongoing refusal to work with the\nvictims vis-\u00e0-vis clarification and empathy assignments. The\nfact that youth entered Alford pleas to two of the charged\noffenses does not explain or excuse his present-day refusal\nto complete treatment, and it did not require the juvenile\ncourt to ignore his treatment deficiencies. First, youth failed\nto complete the clarification and empathy assignments even\nwith respect to the victim of the offense to which he offered\nhis outright admission. And second, youth\u2019s decision not to\ncontest two of the charges and to necessarily accept being\nadjudicated on those charges does not explain his refusal to\ncomplete treatment, his resulting violation of probation, or\nhis decision to opt out of treatment even when it was again\noffered to him. Also, the juvenile court was free to accept or\nreject the expert testimony it heard about sexual recidivism\n\f150                                          State v. B. J. P.\n\nrates and treatment. See Kotler and Winnett, 282 Or App\n584, 598, 385 P3d 1200 (2016) (explaining that a witness\u2019s\n\u201ctestimony was not entitled to greater weight simply because\n[the witness] is an expert; as with all conflicting evidence,\nthe probative value of such evidence is solely for the trial\ncourt to determine\u201d). Given all that, we cannot say that the\nrecord compelled the court to conclude other than it did.\n        Affirmed.\n\f",

J.\n         Youth appeals a juvenile court order denying his\npetition to dismiss jurisdiction. In his petition, youth sought\npost-adjudication relief, under both the state and federal con-\nstitutions, on a claim under ORS 419C.615(1)(a)1 that his trial\ncounsel was constitutionally inadequate and ineffective in fail-\ning to move to suppress statements that youth made to police,\nand that, had those statements been suppressed, he would\nnot have admitted to conduct that, if committed by an adult,\nwould constitute one count of second-degree sexual abuse, ORS\n163.425, and one count of strangulation, ORS 163.187.\n         On appeal, youth raises one assignment of error,\nin which he contends that the juvenile court erred in deny-\ning his petition to dismiss jurisdiction, as trial counsel was\ninadequate and ineffective in failing to file a motion to sup-\npress youth\u2019s statements to police. Accepting the juvenile\ncourt\u2019s supported implicit and explicit factual findings and\nreviewing for legal error, State v. C. L. E., 316 Or App 5, 6,\n502 P3d 1154 (2021), we affirm.\n         In evaluating whether youth was entitled to post-\nadjudication relief under ORS 419C.615(1)(a), \u201cwe apply\nthe constitutional standards for inadequate and ineffec-\ntive assistance of counsel that have been developed at the\nstate and federal level in the context of post-conviction and\nhabeas corpus relief.\u201d State v. J. J.-M., 282 Or App 459, 463,\n387 P3d 426 (2016). To prevail on a claim of inadequate and\nineffective assistance of counsel under those constitutional\nstandards, youth must have proved both a performance and\na prejudice prong. Id. at 464; see also Johnson v. Premo, 315\nOr App 1, 8, 499 P3d 814 (2021) (stating the \u201cfunctionally\nequivalent\u201d standards for inadequate and ineffective assis-\ntance of counsel under the state and federal constitutions).\n     1\n       ORS 419C.615 provides, as relevant:\n          \u201c(1) In addition to any other grounds upon which a person may petition\n     a court under ORS 419C.610, a person may petition the court on the following\n     grounds to set aside an order finding the person to be within the jurisdiction\n     of the court under ORS 419C.005:\n          \u201c(a) A substantial denial in the proceedings resulting in the person\u2019s\n     adjudication, or in the appellate review of the adjudication, of the person\u2019s\n     rights under the United States Constitution or the Oregon Constitution, or\n     both, and the denial rendered the adjudication void[.]\u201d\n\fCite as 339 Or App 35 (2025)                                 37\n\n         Youth argues that the juvenile court erred when it\ndenied youth relief on his claim of inadequate and ineffec-\ntive assistance of counsel. As youth sees it, his trial coun-\nsel\u2019s performance was deficient because youth \u201chad a meri-\ntorious argument that his statements [to police] should have\nbeen suppressed\u201d but trial counsel \u201cdid not see a suppression\nissue.\u201d The state responds that \u201cyouth failed to prove that\nhis attorney performed deficiently by pursuing an early,\nfavorable resolution rather than filing a motion to suppress\u201d\nor that \u201cthe alleged deficient performance resulted in preju-\ndice.\u201d We address each prong\u2014the performance prong and\nthe prejudice prong\u2014in turn.\n          Regarding the performance prong, it was youth\u2019s\nburden to prove that \u201c \u2018counsel\u2019s decision reflects an absence\nof professional skill and judgment, a question that turns on\nthe facts known at the time that counsel made that deci-\nsion.\u2019 \u201d C. L. E., 316 Or App at 10 (quoting Davis v. Kelly, 303\nOr App 253, 262, 461 P3d 1043, rev den, 366 Or 826 (2020)).\n         Applying that standard here, the record reflects\nthat trial counsel\u2019s decision not to pursue suppression of\nyouth\u2019s statements to police did not reflect an absence of\nprofessional skill and judgment. Youth\u2019s trial counsel testi-\nfied at the hearing on the petition to set aside jurisdiction\nthat she had viewed the evidence of the police interrogation\nof youth and opined that it \u201clooked like a revocation of any\ninvoking of his right to remain silent.\u201d That is, suppression\nof youth\u2019s statements was unlikely to be successful, because,\nalthough youth invoked his right to remain silent, he sub-\nsequently spoke to police after receiving Miranda warnings,\nand he was also evaluated by a doctor who concluded that\nthere were no concerns regarding youth\u2019s ability to under-\nstand his Miranda rights. See State v. McAnulty, 356 Or 432,\n458, 338 P3d 653 (2014) (explaining that when a suspect has\ninvoked their right to remain silent, \u201cpolice may reinitiate\ncontact after a reasonable time, provide new Miranda warn-\nings, and obtain a valid waiver\u201d). We do not understand this\nto be a case where youth\u2019s trial counsel simply failed to \u201csee\u201d\na meritorious legal issue, as youth contends.\n         Further, trial counsel\u2019s testimony reflects that other\nfactors in youth\u2019s case bore on trial counsel\u2019s decision not to\n\f38                                           State v. D. W. N.\n\npursue suppression, including that the state would revoke\nits plea offer on the filing of that motion and might charge\nyouth as an adult; that a successful motion would likely lead\nto a trial on the more serious charge of first-degree rape;\nthat the victim was \u201cadamant\u201d about the case going to trial;\nthat the state would still have the victim\u2019s statements as\nevidence even if youth\u2019s statements were suppressed; and\nthat youth would not be able to testify even if his statements\nwere suppressed to avoid \u201copening the door\u201d to admission of\nthose suppressed statements. In addition, an affidavit sub-\nmitted by the prosecutor in youth\u2019s case averred that, had\nthe trial court \u201centertained a suppression of [youth\u2019s state-\nments to police], the [plea] offer would have been immedi-\nately revoked and the state would have proceeded to trial on\nall the allegations in the original petition.\u201d The prosecutor\nfurther averred that, had a motion to suppress been granted,\n\u201cthe state would have absolutely proceeded to trial without\nyouth\u2019s statements[,]\u201d because the remaining evidence, in\nthe prosecutor\u2019s view, \u201cwould have been sufficiently compel-\nling to prove the allegations beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d\n         Thus, we conclude that trial counsel\u2019s decision not to\npursue suppression of youth\u2019s statements was not deficient\nbecause it was a strategic decision and a reasonable exercise\nof professional skill and judgment in response to the circum-\nstances. See, e.g., Gorham v. Thompson, 332 Or 560, 567, 34\nP3d 161 (2001) (explaining that \u201ca reviewing court will not\nsecond-guess a lawyer\u2019s tactical decisions in the name of the\nconstitution unless those decisions reflect an absence or sus-\npension of professional skill and judgment\u201d).\n         But even if that trial counsel\u2019s performance was\ndeficient, we conclude that there was no prejudice. Under\nthe prejudice prong, we \u201cfocus[ ] on whether trial counsel\u2019s\nconstitutionally inadequate performance affected the out-\ncome of the plea process\u201d in cases such as this one \u201cwhere\nthe adjudication is based on a plea.\u201d C. L. E., 316 Or App at\n16. To establish prejudice, youth was required to \u201cshow that\nbut for the inadequate and ineffective assistance, he would\nhave pleaded differently.\u201d Id.\n         The evidence that youth offered to prove prejudice\nis his written declaration in which he attests that, had trial\n\fCite as 339 Or App 35 (2025)                                                     39\n\ncounsel moved to suppress his statements, he \u201cwould not\nhave accepted the plea agreement\u201d and \u201cwould not have\nentered admissions[.]\u201d However, the juvenile court was per-\nmitted to make a determination that youth was not credible.\nConsequently, we conclude that youth did not prove that he\nwas prejudiced by trial counsel\u2019s failure to move to suppress\nhis statements.2\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n       The juvenile court did not explain its reason for denying youth\u2019s petition;\nthat is, it did not indicate whether the denial was based on a determination that\nyouth had failed to meet the performance prong of his claim, the prejudice prong\nof his claim, or both.\n     Youth contends that \u201cbecause the trial court could have denied relief without\nreaching the issue of prejudice, this court should reverse and remand for the\ncourt to consider youth\u2019s evidence [regarding prejudice] in the first instance.\u201d\n     For this court to perform its review function, it is helpful when a lower court\nexplains the basis for its ruling. As the Supreme Court stated in Datt v. Hill,\n347 Or 672, 684, 227 P3d 714 (2010), \u201c[i]t is a truism, and an important one,\nthat a post-conviction trial court can be of great assistance to appellate courts\nby making findings of historical facts and explaining how its conclusions derive\nfrom those findings.\u201d That is, \u201c[a]n understanding of how a post-conviction trial\ncourt actually, rather than presumptively, arrived at its decision enhances the\neffectiveness of appellate review.\u201d Id. at 685; see also Pereida-Alba v. Coursey, 356\nOr 654, 670-71, 342 P3d 70 (2015) (noting that \u201cwe presume that a trial court\nimplicitly resolves factual disputes consistently with its ultimate conclusion\u201d but\nthat \u201c[i]f an implicit factual finding is not necessary to a trial court\u2019s ultimate\nconclusion * * *, then the presumption does not apply\u201d). We think the important\n\u201ctruism\u201d that the Supreme Court observed in Datt applies equally to a claim\nfor post-adjudication relief under ORS 419C.615(1)(a)\u2014the kind of claim at issue\nin this appeal\u2014as it does to a claim seeking relief under the Post-Conviction\nHearings Act\u2014the kind of claim at issue in Datt.\n     In any event, for purposes of our analysis, we have assumed that the juvenile\ncourt denied youth\u2019s motion on either the performance prong, the prejudice prong,\nor both; and, as set forth above, the record was sufficient for the juvenile court\nto have denied youth\u2019s motion on either (or both) of those bases. Remand for the\njuvenile court to address the prejudice prong in the first instance is unnecessary.\nCf. Dickerson v. Fhuere, 316 Or App 62, 67, 501 P3d 1072 (2021) (reversing and\nremanding \u201cbecause the post-conviction court\u2019s decision was based on an error\nof law and, as a result of that error, the court never made the factual determina-\ntions necessary to allow for resolution of petitioner\u2019s claim under the correct legal\nstandard\u201d).\n\f",

In addition, an affidavit sub-\nmitted by the prosecutor in youth\u2019s case averred that, had\nthe trial court \u201centertained a suppression of [youth\u2019s state-\nments to police], the [plea] offer would have been immedi-\nately revoked and the state would have proceeded to trial on\nall the allegations in the original petition.\u201d The prosecutor\nfurther averred that, had a motion to suppress been granted,\n\u201cthe state would have absolutely proceeded to trial without\nyouth\u2019s statements[,]\u201d because the remaining evidence, in\nthe prosecutor\u2019s view, \u201cwould have been sufficiently compel-\nling to prove the allegations beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d\n         Thus, we conclude that trial counsel\u2019s decision not to\npursue suppression of youth\u2019s statements was not deficient\nbecause it was a strategic decision and a reasonable exercise\nof professional skill and judgment in response to the circum-\nstances.

As we explain below, defendant did not do so\nand we, therefore, reject his first assignment as unpreserved.\n         The trial court, on defendant\u2019s request, severed the\nvarious charges into two trials: one for charges connected to\na pair of coffee shop robberies, and one for charges related to\nburglaries at a credit union and a Fred Meyer store.
