P. HOOD, JJ.\\n\\nPER CURIAM.\\n\\n       In this action to recover personal protection insurance (PIP) benefits under the no-fault act,\\nMCL 500.3101 et seq., plaintiff, Elaine Diane Washington, appeals by right the trial court\\u2019s order\\ngranting reconsideration and summary disposition in favor of defendant, Farm Bureau Mutual\\nInsurance Company (Farm Bureau), under MCR 2.119(F) and MCR 2.116(C)(10), respectively.\\nOn appeal, Washington argues that the trial court erred by sua sponte concluding as a matter of\\nlaw that she knowingly made false statements material to her claim for PIP benefits, thereby\\nrendering her ineligible for such benefits under MCL 500.3173a(4). We affirm.\\n\\n                                       I. BACKGROUND\\n\\n        This case stems from Washington\\u2019s involvement in a December 27, 2021 motor vehicle\\ncollision. On that date, Washington was a passenger in an uninsured motor vehicle struck in a\\nbroadside crash. According to a traffic crash report prepared by a Detroit Police Department\\nofficer, Washington did not report any injuries at the scene of the collision.\\n\\n       On January 26, 2022, Washington filed an application with the Michigan Automobile\\nInsurance Placement Facility (MAIPF) for PIP benefits through the Michigan Assigned Claims\\nPlan (MACP), which assigned her claim to Farm Bureau. In her application, Washington stated\\nthat she sustained injuries in the collision, which resulted in pain throughout her entire body,\\nincluding her \\u201ceye, right side, back, neck[,] and left leg.\\u201d Washington claimed that she did not\\nhave any preexisting medical conditions and had not previously incurred any of the injuries she\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                -1-\\n\\fsustained in the collision. She also denied having applied for Social Security disability benefits at\\nany time before or after the collision.\\n\\n        On May 2, 2022, Farm Bureau\\u2019s counsel examined Washington under oath. During the\\nexamination, Washington stated that she injured her neck, back, legs, and knees during the\\ncollision. She also experienced dizziness and sustained bruising but declined medical treatment\\non the date of the collision because she did not wish to be treated at Detroit Receiving Hospital.\\nWashington denied injuring either of her eyes in the collision but explained that she was blind in\\nher right eye because she suffered a detached retina as a child and had a portion of her eye\\nsurgically removed in 2012. Washington also stated that she suffered from carpal tunnel\\nsyndrome, depression, and bipolar disorder and explained that she previously applied for and\\nreceived Social Security benefits1 in relation to those conditions. Washington further denied\\nsustaining traumatic injuries at any point before the collision.\\n\\n        On May 3, 2022, Washington filed a single-count complaint against Farm Bureau in which\\nshe sought to recover unpaid PIP benefits under the no-fault act. On June 7, 2022, Farm Bureau\\nanswered the complaint and filed affirmative defenses. Farm Bureau contended that Washington\\u2019s\\nclaim was barred under MCL 500.3173a because she knowingly made false statements material to\\nher claim in her application for PIP benefits.\\n\\n        On November 16, 2022, Farm Bureau\\u2019s counsel deposed Washington. During her\\ndeposition, Washington recounted an incident in 2012 in which she injured her left arm, bruised\\nher back, and bruised the side of her torso after a panel of cement collapsed from under her, leaving\\nher hanging by her left arm. Washington stated that she received medical treatment and\\nexperienced minor back pain after the incident but could not recall how long her pain persisted.\\nWashington also testified that, at some point after the collision, she injured her right knee when\\nshe slipped and fell in her bathroom. Washington stated that her knee was swollen for roughly\\ntwo weeks after she fell but did not specify whether she had any ongoing pain from the incident.\\nWashington also stated that she began receiving Social Security disability benefits in relation to\\nher depression and bipolar disorder in 2017. She did not know whether she received Social\\nSecurity disability benefits in relation to her right-eye blindness or carpal tunnel syndrome.\\n\\n       On May 16, 2023, Washington amended her application for PIP benefits through the\\nMACP. Washington made several modifications to her application, including that she applied for\\nSocial Security disability benefits beginning in 2015. Washington also attached a five-page\\nsummary of her medical history in support of her amended application. She explained that she\\nhad chronic pain in her back and neck, which stemmed from an unspecified fall that occurred in\\n\\n\\n1\\n  During her examination under oath, Washington stated that she received Supplemental Security\\nIncome. But during her deposition, Washington stated that she received Social Security disability\\nbenefits. While it is unclear from the record whether Washington received Supplemental Security\\nIncome as indicated during her under-oath examination, Washington\\u2019s counsel reiterated that she\\nreceived Social Security disability benefits in her response to Farm Bureau\\u2019s summary disposition\\nmotion. Washington also stated in her amended application for PIP benefits that she applied for\\nSocial Security disability benefits in 2015.\\n\\n\\n                                                -2-\\n\\f2010. In 2012, she was diagnosed with multiple conditions, including cervical pain, chronic\\nlumbar pain, degenerative joint disease, and carpal tunnel syndrome. At some point, she was also\\ndiagnosed with arthritis in her spine and the left side of her torso. Between 2012 and 2020,\\nWashington repeatedly sought medical treatment for cervical and lumbar pain. And between 2017\\nand 2020, Washington repeatedly sought medical treatment for bilateral knee pain.\\n\\n        On May 31, 2023, Farm Bureau moved for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(10).\\nFarm Bureau argued that Washington was ineligible for PIP benefits under MCL 500.3173a(4)\\nbecause she knowingly made false statements material to her claim for such benefits. It argued\\nthat Washington knowingly made false statements regarding her pre-collision medical conditions,\\nher applications for and receipt of Social Security disability benefits, and her post-collision\\nphysical limitations. In support of its assertions, Farm Bureau contrasted the representations in\\nWashington\\u2019s initial application for PIP benefits with those made in her examination under oath,\\ndeposition, amended application for PIP benefits, and summary of her medical history. Farm\\nBureau also proffered a photograph of Washington bending at the waist and picking up a small\\ndog despite her prior assertion that she was unable to perform household tasks such as taking out\\nthe garbage, preparing meals, and making beds.\\n\\n         On June 14, 2023, Washington filed a response in opposition to Farm Bureau\\u2019s summary\\ndisposition motion. Washington acknowledged that she omitted some immaterial facts from her\\ninitial application for PIP benefits but argued that she remedied the omissions by amending her\\napplication for PIP benefits. She asserted that she did not commit a fraudulent insurance act as\\ndefined in MCL 500.4503 because she did not intend to defraud the MACP or Farm Bureau. She\\nexplained that any reasonable person would have difficulty recalling the extent of her medical\\nhistory, and such circumstances established a genuine issue of material fact regarding her intent to\\ndefraud the MACP or Farm Bureau.\\n\\n       On July 3, 2023, the trial court denied Farm Bureau\\u2019s summary disposition motion\\nfollowing a hearing. It explained its reasoning on the record as follows:\\n\\n       Your motion for summary disposition, based on allegations of fraud and material\\n       misrepresentation is denied. I believe that it is . . . a credibility issue for the\\n       factfinder to decide, not this Court. You\\u2019re free to raise these issues at trial, if it\\n       gets this far, whether or not . . . this is all phony, false, fraudulent, misrepresented\\n       material things. I think it\\u2019s for the jury to decide, not the Court.\\n\\n        On July 24, 2023, Farm Bureau moved under MCR 2.119(F)(3) for reconsideration of the\\ntrial court\\u2019s order denying summary disposition in its favor. It argued that the trial court palpably\\nerred by denying its motion for summary disposition because Washington committed a fraudulent\\ninsurance act, and she failed to present any evidence in support of her argument that she did not\\nintentionally make false statements material to her claim for PIP benefits.\\n\\n       On August 22, 2023, the trial court denied Farm Bureau\\u2019s motion for reconsideration. It\\nreasoned that Farm Bureau merely advanced the same arguments in its reconsideration motion as\\nthose advanced in its summary disposition motion, and Farm Bureau otherwise failed to\\ndemonstrate that the trial court was misled by palpable error. On August 30, 2023, the trial court\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                 -3-\\n\\fentered an amended order granting Farm Bureau\\u2019s motion for reconsideration. It concluded that\\nWashington committed a fraudulent insurance act and explained its reasoning, in part, as follows:\\n\\n               In the instant matter, the Court having reviewed [Farm Bureau\\u2019s] motion\\n       for reconsideration and having re-read the examination under oath testimony of\\n       [Washington], the Court is convinced that [Washington] indeed committed material\\n       misrepresentation[s] during her testimony.\\n\\n                                               * * *\\n\\n       Here[,] [Washington] omitted multiple material pieces of information that were\\n       crucial to the application for benefits and in fact flat out made statements that are\\n       demonstrably false regarding the nature and scope of her prior injuries and her\\n       application for Social Security Disability benefits. [Washington] suffered\\n       catastrophic injuries when a side walk collapsed under her in 2012 leaving her both\\n       mentally and physically disabled[;] additionally[,] [Washington] sustained a series\\n       of other injuries that ultimately led her to seek [S]ocial [S]ecurity disability benefits\\n       which was ultimately granted in 2017. Additionally, [Washington] acknowledged\\n       during her examination under oath that her eye was surgically removed as a result\\n       of a preexisting injury in 2012. [Washington] also admitted during her 2022\\n       deposition that she had injur[i]es to her back[,] legs[,] and arms during her 2012\\n       fall. This sworn testimony is in direct contraction [sic] to the statements and\\n       attestation in her application for no[-]fault benefits to the MAIPF wherein she\\n       denied any previous injuries to the same body parts. Accordingly, this Court now\\n       finds that [Washington] omitted multiple material pieces of information that were\\n       crucial to the application for benefits and in fact flat out made statements that are\\n       demonstrably false regarding the nature and scope of her prior injuries and her\\n       application for Social Security Disability benefits. Furthermore[,] the Court further\\n       finds that in previously denying [Farm Bureau\\u2019s] motion for [s]ummary\\n       disposition[,] it committed palpable error that must be corrected.\\n\\nOn September 5, 2023, the trial court entered an order granting summary disposition in favor of\\nFarm Bureau under MCR 2.116(C)(10). This appeal followed.\\n\\n                                 II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW\\n\\n       We review for an abuse of discretion a trial court\\u2019s ruling on a motion for reconsideration.\\nAuto-Owners Ins Co v Compass Healthcare PLC, 326 Mich App 595, 607; 928 NW2d 726 (2018).\\nAn abuse of discretion occurs when the trial court\\u2019s decision falls outside the range of reasonable\\nand principled outcomes. Id.\\n\\n       Whether a party has been afforded due process is a question of law that we review de novo.\\nSouden v Souden, 303 Mich App 406, 412-413; 844 NW2d 151 (2013). We likewise review de\\nnovo a trial court\\u2019s decision to grant or deny a motion for summary disposition. El-Khalil v\\nOakwood Healthcare Inc, 504 Mich 152, 159; 934 NW2d 665 (2019). A motion under MCR\\n2.116(C)(10) tests the factual sufficiency of a claim. Id. at 160. When considering a motion under\\nMCR 2.116(C)(10), the trial court must \\u201cconsider all evidence submitted by the parties in the light\\n\\n\\n                                                 -4-\\n\\fmost favorable to the party opposing the motion.\\u201d Id. The trial court may only grant the motion\\nif there is \\u201cno genuine issue of material fact.\\u201d Id. \\u201cA genuine issue of material fact exists when\\nthe record leaves open an issue upon which reasonable minds might differ.\\u201d Id. (quotation marks\\nand citation omitted). If the proffered evidence fails to establish a genuine issue of material fact,\\nthe moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Innovation Ventures v Liquid Mfg,\\n499 Mich 491, 507; 885 NW2d 861 (2016).\\n\\n                                    III. LAW AND ANALYSIS\\n\\n       On appeal, Washington argues that the trial court erred by sua sponte concluding as a matter\\nof law that she knowingly made false statements material to her claim for PIP benefits, thereby\\nrendering her ineligible for such benefits under MCL 500.3173a(4). We disagree.\\n\\n                               A. PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS\\n\\n       At the threshold, Washington contends that the trial court deprived her of procedural due\\nprocess by sua sponte entering an amended order granting Farm Bureau\\u2019s motion for\\nreconsideration after denying the motion in the first instance. We disagree.\\n\\n       \\u201cDue process is a flexible concept, the essence of which requires fundamental fairness.\\u201d\\nAl-Maliki v LaGrant, 286 Mich App 483, 485; 781 NW2d 853 (2009). \\u201cThe basic requirements\\nof due process in a civil case include notice of the proceeding and a meaningful opportunity to be\\nheard.\\u201d Id.\\n\\n       MCR 2.119(F)(3) governs motions for reconsideration and provides:\\n\\n               Generally, and without restricting the discretion of the court, a motion for\\n       rehearing or reconsideration which merely presents the same issues ruled on by the\\n       court, either expressly or by reasonable implication, will not be granted. The\\n       moving party must demonstrate a palpable error by which the court and the parties\\n       have been misled and show that a different disposition of the motion must result\\n       from correction of the error.\\n\\nTrial courts have \\u201cconsiderable discretion in granting reconsideration to correct mistakes, to\\npreserve judicial economy, and to minimize costs to the parties.\\u201d Sanders v McLaren-Macomb,\\n323 Mich App 254, 264-265; 916 NW2d 305 (2018) (quotation marks and citation omitted).\\nIndeed, this Court has stated that \\u201cif a trial court wants to give a \\u2018second chance\\u2019 to a motion it has\\npreviously denied, it has every right to do so, and . . . MCR 2.119(F)(3) does nothing to prevent\\nthis exercise of discretion.\\u201d Kokx v Bylenga, 241 Mich App 655, 659; 617 NW2d 368 (2000)\\n(quotation marks, citation, and brackets omitted).\\n\\n        Here, the trial court sua sponte entered an amended order granting Farm Bureau\\u2019s motion\\nfor reconsideration after denying the motion in the first instance. Its decision to do so fell within\\nits considerable discretion to grant reconsideration, see Sanders, 323 Mich App at 264-265, and it\\nwas otherwise free to revisit Farm Bureau\\u2019s reconsideration motion that it previously denied, see\\nKokx, 241 Mich App at 659. On these bases, and because Washington does not argue that she was\\ndeprived of notice or a meaningful opportunity to be heard in relation to Farm Bureau\\u2019s summary\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                 -5-\\n\\fdisposition motion, Washington has failed to establish that the trial court deprived her of\\nprocedural due process.\\n\\n                            B. FRAUDULENT INSURANCE ACT\\n\\n        Washington contends that the trial court erred by concluding as a matter of law that she\\nknowingly made false statements material to her claim for PIP benefits, thereby rendering her\\nineligible for such benefits under MCL 500.3173a(4). We again disagree.\\n\\n        \\u201cWhen an individual cannot obtain no-fault insurance coverage after an accident through\\nordinary means, the MAIPF fills in the gaps.\\u201d Williamson v AAA of Mich, 513 Mich 264, 271; 15\\nNW3d 546 (2024). \\u201cThe no-fault act directs the MAIPF to \\u2018adopt and maintain an assigned claims\\nplan.\\u2019 \\u201d Id., quoting MCL 500.3171(2). \\u201cThe Legislature thus established the MACP to provide\\nan injured person with coverage when there is no other applicable insurer.\\u201d Williamson, 513 Mich\\nat 271, citing MCL 500.3172(1).\\n\\n       MCL 500.3173a(4) addresses fraud with respect to claims submitted to the MAIPF. This\\nprovision provides:\\n\\n               A person who presents or causes to be presented an oral or written\\n       statement, including computer-generated information, as part of or in support of a\\n       claim to the Michigan automobile insurance placement facility, or to an insurer to\\n       which the claim is assigned under the assigned claims plan, for payment or another\\n       benefit knowing that the statement contains false information concerning a fact or\\n       thing material to the claim commits a fraudulent insurance act under [MCL\\n       500.4503] that is subject to the penalties imposed under [MCL 500.4511]. A claim\\n       that contains or is supported by a fraudulent insurance act as described in this\\n       subsection is ineligible for payment of personal protection insurance benefits under\\n       the assigned claims plan. [MCL 500.3173a(4).]\\n\\nIn Candler v Farm Bureau Mut Ins Co of Mich, 321 Mich App 772, 779-780; 910 NW2d 666\\n(2017), we held that a person commits a fraudulent insurance act under MCL 500.3173a when:\\n\\n        (1) the person presents or causes to be presented an oral or written statement, (2)\\n       the statement is part of or in support of a claim for no-fault benefits, and (3) the\\n       claim for benefits was submitted to the MAIPF. Further, (4) the person must have\\n       known that the statement contained false information, and (5) the statement\\n       concerned a fact or thing material to the claim.\\n\\nIn Brakeman v Citizens Ins Co of the Midwest, 344 Mich App 66; 998 NW2d 743 (2022), we\\nclarified that the only scienter requirement to establish a fraudulent insurance act is \\u201cmere\\nknowledge that the statement contains false information concerning a fact or thing material to the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                               -6-\\n\\fclaim.\\u201d Id. at 74 (quotation marks and citation omitted).2 And in Fashho v Liberty Mut Ins Co,\\n333 Mich App 612, 618; 963 NW2d 695 (2020), we explained that \\u201c[a] statement is material if it\\nis reasonably relevant to the insurer\\u2019s investigation of a claim.\\u201d (quotation marks and citation\\nomitted).\\n\\n        Here, the trial court did not err by concluding as a matter of law that Washington knowingly\\nmade false statements material to her claim for PIP benefits. The record reflects that Washington\\nmisrepresented the nature and extent of her preexisting medical conditions and injuries. In her\\noriginal application for PIP benefits, Washington stated that she sustained injuries in the collision,\\nresulting in pain throughout her entire body, including her eye, right side, back, neck, and left leg.\\nWashington claimed that she did not have any preexisting medical conditions and had not\\npreviously incurred any of the injuries she sustained in the collision. But she later disclosed that\\nthat she was blind in her right eye because she suffered a detached retina as a child and had a\\nportion of her eye surgically removed in 2012. She recounted an incident in 2012 in which she\\nsustained injuries after a panel of cement collapsed from under her. And she disclosed that she\\nwas diagnosed with or sought treatment for several conditions before the collision, including\\ncervical pain, lumbar pain, degenerative joint disease, carpal tunnel syndrome, arthritis, and\\nbilateral knee pain. The record therefore reflects that Washington made false statements material\\nto her claim for PIP benefits.3\\n\\n        Washington further contends that her cognitive abilities, depression, bipolar disorder, and\\nright-eye blindness established a genuine issue of material fact as to whether she knew that\\nstatements within her original application for PIP benefits were false. We disagree. Washington\\nfailed to proffer evidence that she suffered from any form of cognitive impairment that impacted\\nher memory or comprehension when she prepared her original application for PIP benefits. She\\nalso demonstrated her ability to recall salient aspects of her medical history during her under-oath\\n\\n\\n2\\n MCL 500.4503, which is part of the Insurance Code of 1956, MCL 500.100 et seq., provides that\\na \\u201cfraudulent insurance act includes, but is not limited to, acts or omissions committed by any\\nperson who knowingly, and with an intent to injure, defraud, or deceive\\u201d engages in certain defined\\nconduct. In Gary v Farmers Ins Exch, ___ Mich App ___, ___; ___ NW3d ___ (2023) (Docket\\nNo. 361880); slip op at 6, Judge SHAPIRO authored a concurrence expressing his disagreement with\\nour holding in Brakeman and reasoning that MCL 500.3173a(4) should be read in conjunction\\nwith MCL 500.4503, such that fraudulent insurance acts require proof of intent to injure, defraud,\\nor deceive. Gary, ___ Mich App at ___; slip op at 7 (SHAPIRO, J., concurring). Washington urges\\nus to endorse the reasoning in Judge SHAPIRO\\u2019S concurrence and indicate disagreement with\\nBrakeman in accordance with the conflict-resolution procedure set forth in MCR 7.215(J)(3). We\\ndecline to do so.\\n3\\n  Washington suggests that any possible false statements made during discovery cannot render her\\nineligible for PIP benefits under MCL 500.3173a(4). We disagree. In Williamson, 513 Mich\\nat 275, our Supreme Court held that \\u201cMCL 500.3173a(4), the statutory provision governing\\nfraudulent insurance acts in the filing of a claim for no-fault benefits, applies to misrepresentations\\noffered during discovery.\\u201d Regardless, discovery in this case largely revealed the falsity of\\nstatements within Washington\\u2019s original application for PIP benefits rather than false testimony or\\nmisrepresentations within written discovery responses.\\n\\n\\n                                                 -7-\\n\\fexamination and deposition. Additionally, although Washington presented evidence that she was\\nblind in her right eye, she failed to present any evidence that she lacked the ability to read or\\notherwise misread the original application for PIP benefits when she prepared it. The conditions\\nidentified by Washington, without more, are insufficient to establish a genuine issue of material\\nfact as to whether she knew that statements within her original application for PIP benefits were\\nfalse.\\n\\n                                      IV. CONCLUSION\\n\\n       The trial court did not deprive Washington of procedural due process by sua sponte\\nentering an amended order granting Farm Bureau\\u2019s motion for reconsideration after denying the\\nmotion in the first instance. Nor did the trial court err by concluding as a matter of law that\\nWashington knowingly made false statements material to her claim for PIP benefits, thereby\\nrendering her ineligible for such benefits under MCL 500.3173a(4). We therefore affirm.\\n\\n                                                           /s/ Christopher P.

We affirm.\\n\\n                                       I. BACKGROUND\\n\\n        This case stems from Washington\\u2019s involvement in a December 27, 2021 motor vehicle\\ncollision. On that date, Washington was a passenger in an uninsured motor vehicle struck in a\\nbroadside crash. According to a traffic crash report prepared by a Detroit Police Department\\nofficer, Washington did not report any injuries at the scene of the collision.\\n\\n       On January 26, 2022, Washington filed an application with the Michigan Automobile\\nInsurance Placement Facility (MAIPF) for PIP benefits through the Michigan Assigned Claims\\nPlan (MACP), which assigned her claim to Farm Bureau. In her application, Washington stated\\nthat she sustained injuries in the collision, which resulted in pain throughout her entire body,\\nincluding her \\u201ceye, right side, back, neck[,] and left leg.\\u201d Washington claimed that she did not\\nhave any preexisting medical conditions and had not previously incurred any of the injuries she\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                -1-\\n\\fsustained in the collision. She also denied having applied for Social Security disability benefits at\\nany time before or after the collision.\\n\\n        On May 2, 2022, Farm Bureau\\u2019s counsel examined Washington under oath. During the\\nexamination, Washington stated that she injured her neck, back, legs, and knees during the\\ncollision. She also experienced dizziness and sustained bruising but declined medical treatment\\non the date of the collision because she did not wish to be treated at Detroit Receiving Hospital.\\nWashington denied injuring either of her eyes in the collision but explained that she was blind in\\nher right eye because she suffered a detached retina as a child and had a portion of her eye\\nsurgically removed in 2012. Washington also stated that she suffered from carpal tunnel\\nsyndrome, depression, and bipolar disorder and explained that she previously applied for and\\nreceived Social Security benefits1 in relation to those conditions. Washington further denied\\nsustaining traumatic injuries at any point before the collision.\\n\\n        On May 3, 2022, Washington filed a single-count complaint against Farm Bureau in which\\nshe sought to recover unpaid PIP benefits under the no-fault act. On June 7, 2022, Farm Bureau\\nanswered the complaint and filed affirmative defenses. Farm Bureau contended that Washington\\u2019s\\nclaim was barred under MCL 500.3173a because she knowingly made false statements material to\\nher claim in her application for PIP benefits.\\n\\n        On November 16, 2022, Farm Bureau\\u2019s counsel deposed Washington. During her\\ndeposition, Washington recounted an incident in 2012 in which she injured her left arm, bruised\\nher back, and bruised the side of her torso after a panel of cement collapsed from under her, leaving\\nher hanging by her left arm. Washington stated that she received medical treatment and\\nexperienced minor back pain after the incident but could not recall how long her pain persisted.\\nWashington also testified that, at some point after the collision, she injured her right knee when\\nshe slipped and fell in her bathroom. Washington stated that her knee was swollen for roughly\\ntwo weeks after she fell but did not specify whether she had any ongoing pain from the incident.\\nWashington also stated that she began receiving Social Security disability benefits in relation to\\nher depression and bipolar disorder in 2017. She did not know whether she received Social\\nSecurity disability benefits in relation to her right-eye blindness or carpal tunnel syndrome.\\n\\n       On May 16, 2023, Washington amended her application for PIP benefits through the\\nMACP. Washington made several modifications to her application, including that she applied for\\nSocial Security disability benefits beginning in 2015. Washington also attached a five-page\\nsummary of her medical history in support of her amended application. She explained that she\\nhad chronic pain in her back and neck, which stemmed from an unspecified fall that occurred in\\n\\n\\n1\\n  During her examination under oath, Washington stated that she received Supplemental Security\\nIncome. But during her deposition, Washington stated that she received Social Security disability\\nbenefits. While it is unclear from the record whether Washington received Supplemental Security\\nIncome as indicated during her under-oath examination, Washington\\u2019s counsel reiterated that she\\nreceived Social Security disability benefits in her response to Farm Bureau\\u2019s summary disposition\\nmotion. Washington also stated in her amended application for PIP benefits that she applied for\\nSocial Security disability benefits in 2015.\\n\\n\\n                                                -2-\\n\\f2010. In 2012, she was diagnosed with multiple conditions, including cervical pain, chronic\\nlumbar pain, degenerative joint disease, and carpal tunnel syndrome. At some point, she was also\\ndiagnosed with arthritis in her spine and the left side of her torso. Between 2012 and 2020,\\nWashington repeatedly sought medical treatment for cervical and lumbar pain. And between 2017\\nand 2020, Washington repeatedly sought medical treatment for bilateral knee pain.\\n\\n        On May 31, 2023, Farm Bureau moved for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(10).\\nFarm Bureau argued that Washington was ineligible for PIP benefits under MCL 500.3173a(4)\\nbecause she knowingly made false statements material to her claim for such benefits. It argued\\nthat Washington knowingly made false statements regarding her pre-collision medical conditions,\\nher applications for and receipt of Social Security disability benefits, and her post-collision\\nphysical limitations. In support of its assertions, Farm Bureau contrasted the representations in\\nWashington\\u2019s initial application for PIP benefits with those made in her examination under oath,\\ndeposition, amended application for PIP benefits, and summary of her medical history. Farm\\nBureau also proffered a photograph of Washington bending at the waist and picking up a small\\ndog despite her prior assertion that she was unable to perform household tasks such as taking out\\nthe garbage, preparing meals, and making beds.\\n\\n         On June 14, 2023, Washington filed a response in opposition to Farm Bureau\\u2019s summary\\ndisposition motion. Washington acknowledged that she omitted some immaterial facts from her\\ninitial application for PIP benefits but argued that she remedied the omissions by amending her\\napplication for PIP benefits. She asserted that she did not commit a fraudulent insurance act as\\ndefined in MCL 500.4503 because she did not intend to defraud the MACP or Farm Bureau. She\\nexplained that any reasonable person would have difficulty recalling the extent of her medical\\nhistory, and such circumstances established a genuine issue of material fact regarding her intent to\\ndefraud the MACP or Farm Bureau.\\n\\n       On July 3, 2023, the trial court denied Farm Bureau\\u2019s summary disposition motion\\nfollowing a hearing. It explained its reasoning on the record as follows:\\n\\n       Your motion for summary disposition, based on allegations of fraud and material\\n       misrepresentation is denied. I believe that it is . . . a credibility issue for the\\n       factfinder to decide, not this Court. You\\u2019re free to raise these issues at trial, if it\\n       gets this far, whether or not . . . this is all phony, false, fraudulent, misrepresented\\n       material things. I think it\\u2019s for the jury to decide, not the Court.\\n\\n        On July 24, 2023, Farm Bureau moved under MCR 2.119(F)(3) for reconsideration of the\\ntrial court\\u2019s order denying summary disposition in its favor. It argued that the trial court palpably\\nerred by denying its motion for summary disposition because Washington committed a fraudulent\\ninsurance act, and she failed to present any evidence in support of her argument that she did not\\nintentionally make false statements material to her claim for PIP benefits.\\n\\n       On August 22, 2023, the trial court denied Farm Bureau\\u2019s motion for reconsideration. It\\nreasoned that Farm Bureau merely advanced the same arguments in its reconsideration motion as\\nthose advanced in its summary disposition motion, and Farm Bureau otherwise failed to\\ndemonstrate that the trial court was misled by palpable error. On August 30, 2023, the trial court\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                 -3-\\n\\fentered an amended order granting Farm Bureau\\u2019s motion for reconsideration. It concluded that\\nWashington committed a fraudulent insurance act and explained its reasoning, in part, as follows:\\n\\n               In the instant matter, the Court having reviewed [Farm Bureau\\u2019s] motion\\n       for reconsideration and having re-read the examination under oath testimony of\\n       [Washington], the Court is convinced that [Washington] indeed committed material\\n       misrepresentation[s] during her testimony.\\n\\n                                               * * *\\n\\n       Here[,] [Washington] omitted multiple material pieces of information that were\\n       crucial to the application for benefits and in fact flat out made statements that are\\n       demonstrably false regarding the nature and scope of her prior injuries and her\\n       application for Social Security Disability benefits. [Washington] suffered\\n       catastrophic injuries when a side walk collapsed under her in 2012 leaving her both\\n       mentally and physically disabled[;] additionally[,] [Washington] sustained a series\\n       of other injuries that ultimately led her to seek [S]ocial [S]ecurity disability benefits\\n       which was ultimately granted in 2017. Additionally, [Washington] acknowledged\\n       during her examination under oath that her eye was surgically removed as a result\\n       of a preexisting injury in 2012. [Washington] also admitted during her 2022\\n       deposition that she had injur[i]es to her back[,] legs[,] and arms during her 2012\\n       fall. This sworn testimony is in direct contraction [sic] to the statements and\\n       attestation in her application for no[-]fault benefits to the MAIPF wherein she\\n       denied any previous injuries to the same body parts. Accordingly, this Court now\\n       finds that [Washington] omitted multiple material pieces of information that were\\n       crucial to the application for benefits and in fact flat out made statements that are\\n       demonstrably false regarding the nature and scope of her prior injuries and her\\n       application for Social Security Disability benefits. Furthermore[,] the Court further\\n       finds that in previously denying [Farm Bureau\\u2019s] motion for [s]ummary\\n       disposition[,] it committed palpable error that must be corrected.\\n\\nOn September 5, 2023, the trial court entered an order granting summary disposition in favor of\\nFarm Bureau under MCR 2.116(C)(10). This appeal followed.\\n\\n                                 II.

The record reflects that Washington\\nmisrepresented the nature and extent of her preexisting medical conditions and injuries. In her\\noriginal application for PIP benefits, Washington stated that she sustained injuries in the collision,\\nresulting in pain throughout her entire body, including her eye, right side, back, neck, and left leg.\\nWashington claimed that she did not have any preexisting medical conditions and had not\\npreviously incurred any of the injuries she sustained in the collision. But she later disclosed that\\nthat she was blind in her right eye because she suffered a detached retina as a child and had a\\nportion of her eye surgically removed in 2012. She recounted an incident in 2012 in which she\\nsustained injuries after a panel of cement collapsed from under her. And she disclosed that she\\nwas diagnosed with or sought treatment for several conditions before the collision, including\\ncervical pain, lumbar pain, degenerative joint disease, carpal tunnel syndrome, arthritis, and\\nbilateral knee pain. The record therefore reflects that Washington made false statements material\\nto her claim for PIP benefits.3\\n\\n        Washington further contends that her cognitive abilities, depression, bipolar disorder, and\\nright-eye blindness established a genuine issue of material fact as to whether she knew that\\nstatements within her original application for PIP benefits were false. We disagree. Washington\\nfailed to proffer evidence that she suffered from any form of cognitive impairment that impacted\\nher memory or comprehension when she prepared her original application for PIP benefits. She\\nalso demonstrated her ability to recall salient aspects of her medical history during her under-oath\\n\\n\\n2\\n MCL 500.4503, which is part of the Insurance Code of 1956, MCL 500.100 et seq., provides that\\na \\u201cfraudulent insurance act includes, but is not limited to, acts or omissions committed by any\\nperson who knowingly, and with an intent to injure, defraud, or deceive\\u201d engages in certain defined\\nconduct. In Gary v Farmers Ins Exch, ___ Mich App ___, ___; ___ NW3d ___ (2023) (Docket\\nNo. 361880); slip op at 6, Judge SHAPIRO authored a concurrence expressing his disagreement with\\nour holding in Brakeman and reasoning that MCL 500.3173a(4) should be read in conjunction\\nwith MCL 500.4503, such that fraudulent insurance acts require proof of intent to injure, defraud,\\nor deceive. Gary, ___ Mich App at ___; slip op at 7 (SHAPIRO, J., concurring). Washington urges\\nus to endorse the reasoning in Judge SHAPIRO\\u2019S concurrence and indicate disagreement with\\nBrakeman in accordance with the conflict-resolution procedure set forth in MCR 7.215(J)(3). We\\ndecline to do so.\\n3\\n  Washington suggests that any possible false statements made during discovery cannot render her\\nineligible for PIP benefits under MCL 500.3173a(4). We disagree. In Williamson, 513 Mich\\nat 275, our Supreme Court held that \\u201cMCL 500.3173a(4), the statutory provision governing\\nfraudulent insurance acts in the filing of a claim for no-fault benefits, applies to misrepresentations\\noffered during discovery.\\u201d Regardless, discovery in this case largely revealed the falsity of\\nstatements within Washington\\u2019s original application for PIP benefits rather than false testimony or\\nmisrepresentations within written discovery responses.\\n\\n\\n                                                 -7-\\n\\fexamination and deposition. Additionally, although Washington presented evidence that she was\\nblind in her right eye, she failed to present any evidence that she lacked the ability to read or\\notherwise misread the original application for PIP benefits when she prepared it. The conditions\\nidentified by Washington, without more, are insufficient to establish a genuine issue of material\\nfact as to whether she knew that statements within her original application for PIP benefits were\\nfalse.\\n\\n                                      IV. CONCLUSION\\n\\n       The trial court did not deprive Washington of procedural due process by sua sponte\\nentering an amended order granting Farm Bureau\\u2019s motion for reconsideration after denying the\\nmotion in the first instance. Nor did the trial court err by concluding as a matter of law that\\nWashington knowingly made false statements material to her claim for PIP benefits, thereby\\nrendering her ineligible for such benefits under MCL 500.3173a(4).

The funds were originally to go to\\ndecedent\\u2019s daughter, Dedra McBurrows-Sherrod, but in July 2022, decedent transferred the money\\nto a new account and made the beneficiary of that new account his brother, appellant Michael\\nSherrod. Shortly after decedent passed away in October 2022, McBurrows-Sherrod, as personal\\nrepresentative of Clyde Lamont Sherrod\\u2019s Estate, challenged Michael\\u2019s title to the funds in the\\nDMCU account on grounds of undue influence. Following a bench trial, the trial court found that\\n(1) McBurrows-Sherrod had presented sufficient evidence to establish a presumption of undue\\ninfluence, and (2) despite Michael\\u2019s rebuttal evidence, McBurrows-Sherrod had established by a\\npreponderance of the evidence that Michael unduly influenced decedent to name Michael the\\nbeneficiary of the DMCU account. Michael appeals that ruling as of right. We conclude that\\nMcBurrows-Sherrod failed to present sufficient evidence to establish a fiduciary or confidential\\nrelationship between Michael and decedent, which means that McBurrows-Sherrod failed to\\nestablish a presumption of undue influence. Without that presumption, McBurrows-Sherrod\\u2019s\\nundue-influence claim fails. For these reasons, as explained more fully in this opinion, we reverse.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                -1-\\n\\f                                       I. BACKGROUND\\n\\n       On March 28, 2022, decedent was admitted to the hospital with signs of heart failure, and\\na few days later on April 1, he underwent quadruple-bypass surgery. Decedent was discharged on\\nApril 13, 2022, but was readmitted to the emergency room on April 18, which resulted in another\\nsurgery being performed on April 30, 2022, to remove a portion of decedent\\u2019s colon. Decedent\\nwas discharged on May 5, 2022, only to be readmitted to the emergency room the on May 7.\\nDuring decedent\\u2019s ensuing hospital stay, it was noted that decedent had become depressed due to\\nhis repeated hospitalizations and had lost significant weight since March 2022. Decedent was\\ndischarged to rehab on May 14, 2022, where he remained until June 2, 2022.\\n\\n       A short time after being discharged home, however, decedent was readmitted to the\\nhospital, where he was diagnosed with episodic memory loss and dangerously-low blood pressure.\\nThe record is not a model of clarity, but it appears that, at some point shortly after this visit,\\ndecedent was discharged to a nursing home, where he remained until July 7, 2022.\\n\\n        It was during decedent\\u2019s stay at the nursing home that Michael first visited decedent on\\nJuly 2. Michael did not visit decedent at any point before July 2, despite knowing that decedent\\nwas in and out of the hospital. Michael justified his absence by explaining that he visited decedent\\nwhen decedent called him, which was in July. Despite his absence, Michael testified that he had\\na close relationship with decedent. Others, however, testified that the two generally disliked each\\nother. Regardless, Michael testified that, when decedent called him in July, Michael went to visit\\nhim, and after decedent was discharged, Michael would occasionally pick up decedent from his\\nhome to go out to lunch.\\n\\n        On July 11, 2022, Michael drove decedent to the police station, where decedent filed a\\nreport alleging that his daughter, McBurrows-Sherrod, was mismanaging his money and failed to\\ntake care of him. There was and still is no evidence to support this accusation. Nevertheless,\\ndecedent believed it, and due to his continuing concern about McBurrows-Sherrod\\u2019s handling of\\nhis money, decedent asked Michael to take decedent to DMCU on July 13, 2022, so that decedent\\ncould remove McBurrows-Sherrod\\u2019s access to decedent\\u2019s account there. Michael agreed.\\n\\n        When the two arrived at DMCU on July 13, Michael pushed decedent\\u2019s wheelchair to the\\noffice of the branch manager, Leah Lindsay. Michael stayed in Lindsay\\u2019s office with decedent\\nand Lindsay while decedent conducted his business, but Michael stayed mostly silent. Decedent\\nasked Lindsay to remove McBurrows-Sherrod\\u2019s power of attorney for decedent and to revoke her\\naccess to decedent\\u2019s accounts, voicing his ongoing concern about McBurrows-Sherrod\\u2019s handling\\nof decedent\\u2019s finances. Lindsay suggested that decedent resolve his concern by simply opening a\\nnew account, and decedent agreed. Decedent named Michael as the beneficiary for this new\\naccount. After the new account was created, the funds from decedent\\u2019s old account were\\ntransferred to his new account. Michael did not tell McBurrows-Sherrod or anyone else in the\\nfamily about either this trip to DMCU or the trip to the police station. He explained that he felt\\nthat he needed to keep the trips a secret because decedent told Michael that he was the only person\\nthat decedent could trust. Michael later took decedent to DMCU a second time because, when\\ndecedent created his new account, decedent\\u2019s driver\\u2019s license was expired, and he needed to\\nprovide a valid one. On this second trip to DMCU, Michael did not go into the bank with decedent.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                -2-\\n\\f        On July 17, 2022\\u2014four days after creating the new DMCU account\\u2014decedent was\\nreadmitted to the hospital, and his records from that visit noted that decedent\\u2019s memory was\\nimpaired. Dr. Anthony Martin, decedent\\u2019s treating physician, opined that decedent\\u2019s cognitive\\nissue was likely caused by a lack of oxygen to decedent\\u2019s brain. Dr. Martin explained that, when\\ndecedent was discharged in early July, he was given at-home treatment instructions to ensure\\nproper blood flow (like wrapping his legs), but if decedent did not comply with his treatment plan,\\nthe result was a lack of oxygen to decedent\\u2019s brain, affecting his cognitive abilities. In subsequent\\nvisits decedent had with Dr. Martin, Dr. Martin noted continuing issues with decedent\\u2019s cognitive\\nfunctions. When decedent was placed on oxygen during those visits, his confusion dissipated.\\n\\n       Decedent passed away on October 3, 2022. Lindsay testified that Michael called her on\\nOctober 4 to inform her of decedent\\u2019s death, and to start the process of closing decedent\\u2019s DMCU\\naccount and sending the funds to Michael as the beneficiary.\\n\\n        Shortly thereafter, McBurrows-Sherrod filed an emergency ex parte motion seeking to\\nenjoin Michael from withdrawing any funds from the DMCU account, which the trial court\\ngranted. This litigation seeking to settle ownership of the DMCU account ensued. Eventually, the\\nlower court held a bench trial to determine whether Michael unduly influenced decedent to name\\nhim the beneficiary of the DMCU account. At the close of the trial, the court held that McBurrows-\\nSherrod established a presumption of undue influence and that Michael\\u2019s rebuttal evidence was\\n\\u201cmuch weaker evidence than the evidence offered to support the presumption of undue influence,\\u201d\\nso the court found by a preponderance of the evidence that Michael unduly influenced decedent to\\nname Michael the beneficiary of decedent\\u2019s DMCU account.\\n\\n       This appeal followed.\\n\\n                         II. PRESUMPTION OF UNDUE INFLUENCE\\n\\n      Michael argues the trial court erred by finding that McBurrows-Sherrod established a\\npresumption of undue influence. We agree.\\n\\n                                  A. STANDARD OF REVIEW\\n\\n         A probate court\\u2019s findings following a bench trial are reviewed for clear error. In re Estate\\nof Bennett, 255 Mich App 545, 549; 662 NW2d 772 (2003). \\u201cA finding is clearly erroneous when\\nthe reviewing court is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made, even\\nif there is evidence to support the finding.\\u201d Id. This Court gives deference to trial courts on matters\\nof credibility. In re Estate of Erickson, 202 Mich App 329, 331; 508 NW2d 181 (1993).\\n\\n                                           B. ANALYSIS\\n\\n        Establishing that a will or contract was the result of undue influence vitiates the instrument\\nbecause it establishes that the instrument was not the result of the testator\\u2019s or contracting party\\u2019s\\nfree will. See In re McKeand, 185 Mich 97, 120; 151 NW 731 (1915). \\u201cTo establish undue\\ninfluence it must be shown that the grantor was subjected to threats, misrepresentation, undue\\nflattery, fraud, or physical or moral coercion sufficient to overpower volition, destroy free agency\\nand impel the grantor to act against his inclination and free will.\\u201d In re Estate of Karmey, 468\\n\\n\\n                                                 -3-\\n\\fMich 68, 75; 658 NW2d 796 (2003) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Certain circumstances\\nare so suggestive of undue influence that, if those circumstances are established, it will give rise\\nto a presumption of undue influence:\\n\\n       The presumption of undue influence is brought to life upon the introduction of\\n       evidence which would establish (1) the existence of a confidential or fiduciary\\n       relationship between the grantor and a fiduciary, (2) the fiduciary or an interest\\n       which he represents benefits from a transaction, and (3) the fiduciary had an\\n       opportunity to influence the grantor\\u2019s decision in that transaction.

On appeal, Michael takes issue with the court\\u2019s finding that\\nMcBurrows-Sherrod established the first element of the presumption\\u2014the existence of a\\nconfidential or fiduciary relationship between Michael and decedent. Clearly, Michael and\\ndecedent did not have a traditional fiduciary relationship like attorney-client or physician-patient,\\nsee In re Estate of Karmey, 468 Mich at 74 n 3, but that is not necessarily fatal. A confidential or\\nfiduciary relationship is a \\u201cbroad\\u201d term, encompassing any relationship \\u201cin which there is\\nconfidence reposed on one side, and the resulting superiority and influence on the other.\\u201d In re\\nWood\\u2019s Estate, 374 Mich 278, 282-283; 132 NW2d 35 (1965). In this way, the term \\u201chas a focused\\nview toward relationships of inequality.\\u201d In re Estate of Karmey, 468 Mich at 74 n 3.\\n\\n        Trust alone is not sufficient to establish a confidential or fiduciary relationship. See Knight\\nv Behringer, 329 Mich 24, 28; 44 NW2d 852 (1950). Rather, a confidential or fiduciary\\nrelationship requires \\u201ca reposing of faith, confidence and trust and the placing of reliance by one\\nupon the judgment and advice of another.\\u201d In re Jennings\\u2019 Estate, 335 Mich 241, 244; 55 NW2d\\n812 (1952) (emphasis added). See also In re Wood\\u2019s Estate, 374 Mich at 282 (stating that a\\nconfidential relationship embraces \\u201cthose informal relations which exist whenever one man trusts\\nin and relies upon another\\u201d) (quotation marks and citation omitted; emphasis added). So, for\\ninstance, a confidential or fiduciary relationship exists when one trusts another and relies on that\\nperson \\u201cin handling the bank accounts for her,\\u201d with the other person acting \\u201csolely as her agent\\nin these transactions.\\u201d Van\\u2019t Hof v Jemison, 291 Mich 385, 393; 289 NW 186 (1939).

Conversely, while people generally trust those they live with, living with\\nanother does not necessarily create a confidential or fiduciary relationship. See In re Carlson\\u2019s\\nEstate, 218 Mich 262, 265; 187 NW 284 (1922) (\\u201cWe have not overlooked the fact that at the time\\nthe will was made the testatrix was living in the home of the proponent, and had been there several\\nweeks . . . . The relation so established was not a fiduciary one, militating against the bequest to\\nproponent.\\u201d). See also Knight, 329 Mich at 29. Likewise, while people generally only allow those\\nthey trust to assist in their business affairs, assisting someone with their business affairs does not\\nnecessarily create a confidential or fiduciary relationship. See In re Cottrell\\u2019s Estate, 235 Mich\\n627, 630; 209 NW 842 (1926) (\\u201cBefore the burden can be cast on proponent, it must be shown that\\nthe fiduciary relations exist, and the fact that she was living with testator when the will was made\\n\\n\\n                                                 -4-\\n\\fdid not establish such relations, nor does the fact that she assisted him in his business affairs\\nestablish such relation.\\u201d) (citations omitted). See also Knight, 329 Mich at 29; Blackman v\\nAndrews, 150 Mich 322, 323-325; 114 NW 218 (1907) (holding that the contestants failed to\\nestablish undue influence despite showing that the proponent\\u2019s husband drove the testatrix to the\\nbank to change her will and had previously given her advice \\u201crespecting her business affairs\\u201d).\\n\\n        Turning back to this case, the trial court found that, when decedent changed the beneficiary\\nof the DMCU account to Michael, a confidential or fiduciary relationship existed between them.\\nDespite finding that Michael generally lacked credibility, the court opined that \\u201ca lot of what\\nMichael testified about supports the theory about a fiduciary relationship regarding this particular\\ntransaction and banking transaction.\\u201d Specifically, the court opined that its finding of a\\nconfidential or fiduciary relationship between decedent and Michael was supported by Michael\\u2019s\\ntestimony that (1) decedent \\u201cneeded Michael Sherrod to help him\\u201d by driving him to the bank after\\nhe became \\u201cvery suspicious of\\u201d McBurrows-Sherrod, (2) decedent told Michael \\u201cyou\\u2019re the only\\nperson I can trust,\\u201d and (3) decedent \\u201credirected all his mail to\\u2014to Michael\\u2019s house with regard\\nto financial issues.\\u201d\\n\\n        This evidence was not sufficient to support a finding of a confidential or fiduciary\\nrelationship. That decedent trusted Michael is necessary for finding that a confidential or fiduciary\\nrelationship existed between them, but trust alone is not enough. See Knight, 329 Mich at 28.\\nRather, to establish that a confidential or fiduciary relationship existed between decedent and\\nMichael, there needed to be evidence that decedent demonstrated his trust in Michael by placing\\nreliance on Michael\\u2019s judgment or advice, see In re Jennings\\u2019 Estate, 335 Mich at 244, and there\\nis no such evidence in the record. For instance, despite decedent\\u2019s redirecting his financial\\nstatements to Michael\\u2019s house, nothing in the record suggests that decedent gave Michael any\\ncontrol over decedent\\u2019s finances such that decedent would have to trust Michael\\u2019s judgment.\\nIndeed, decedent did not even give Michael access to the funds in his DMCU account while\\ndecedent was alive\\u2014decedent only made Michael the beneficiary on his DMCU account. And\\nwhile Michael drove decedent to DMCU in a trip that resulted in decedent naming Michael the\\nbeneficiary of decedent\\u2019s account, this supports only that Michael had the opportunity to influence\\ndecedent; it does not support that a confidential or fiduciary relationship existed between them.\\nSee Blackman, 150 Mich at 323-325; In re Brady\\u2019s Estate, 295 Mich 472, 474-476; 295 NW 230\\n(1940) (holding that \\u201c[n]o confidential relationship existed between either Mr. or Mrs. Knorpp and\\ntestator\\u201d despite evidence that the testator changed his will in front of the Knorpps, and the next\\nday the Knorpps drove the testator to have his will executed and went into the office with the\\ntestator to do so).\\n\\n       We acknowledge that the trial court credited Dr. Martin\\u2019s testimony that decedent may\\nhave been confused around the time of the transaction due to his ongoing medical issues, but we\\ndo not believe that this finding warrants a different result. That is, even if decedent was confused\\naround the time of the transaction, it would not establish that a confidential or fiduciary relationship\\nexisted between Michael and decedent.1 Again, a confidential or fiduciary relationship is\\n\\n\\n1\\n It bears noting that decedent\\u2019s confusion mostly manifested itself in his distrusting McBurrows-\\nSherrod. That distrust caused decedent to ask Michael to drive him to DMCU to remove\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                  -5-\\n\\festablished when one places reliance on another\\u2019s judgment or advice, see In re Jennings\\u2019 Estate,\\n335 Mich at 244, and there is no evidence that decedent relied on Michael\\u2019s judgment or advice.\\n\\n        For these reasons, we conclude that the trial court\\u2019s finding that a confidential or fiduciary\\nrelationship existed between Michael and decedent was clearly erroneous. Without that finding,\\nMcBurrows-Sherrod cannot establish a presumption of undue influence. McBurrows-Sherrod has\\nnever argued that she presented sufficient evidence to establish undue influence absent a\\npresumption, so our conclusion that McBurrows-Sherrod failed to establish the presumption of\\nundue influence resolves this case.2\\n\\n       Reversed.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                              /s/ Adrienne N.

The funds were originally to go to\\ndecedent\\u2019s daughter, Dedra McBurrows-Sherrod, but in July 2022, decedent transferred the money\\nto a new account and made the beneficiary of that new account his brother, appellant Michael\\nSherrod. Shortly after decedent passed away in October 2022, McBurrows-Sherrod, as personal\\nrepresentative of Clyde Lamont Sherrod\\u2019s Estate, challenged Michael\\u2019s title to the funds in the\\nDMCU account on grounds of undue influence. Following a bench trial, the trial court found that\\n(1) McBurrows-Sherrod had presented sufficient evidence to establish a presumption of undue\\ninfluence, and (2) despite Michael\\u2019s rebuttal evidence, McBurrows-Sherrod had established by a\\npreponderance of the evidence that Michael unduly influenced decedent to name Michael the\\nbeneficiary of the DMCU account. Michael appeals that ruling as of right. We conclude that\\nMcBurrows-Sherrod failed to present sufficient evidence to establish a fiduciary or confidential\\nrelationship between Michael and decedent, which means that McBurrows-Sherrod failed to\\nestablish a presumption of undue influence. Without that presumption, McBurrows-Sherrod\\u2019s\\nundue-influence claim fails. For these reasons, as explained more fully in this opinion, we reverse.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                -1-\\n\\f                                       I. BACKGROUND\\n\\n       On March 28, 2022, decedent was admitted to the hospital with signs of heart failure, and\\na few days later on April 1, he underwent quadruple-bypass surgery. Decedent was discharged on\\nApril 13, 2022, but was readmitted to the emergency room on April 18, which resulted in another\\nsurgery being performed on April 30, 2022, to remove a portion of decedent\\u2019s colon. Decedent\\nwas discharged on May 5, 2022, only to be readmitted to the emergency room the on May 7.\\nDuring decedent\\u2019s ensuing hospital stay, it was noted that decedent had become depressed due to\\nhis repeated hospitalizations and had lost significant weight since March 2022. Decedent was\\ndischarged to rehab on May 14, 2022, where he remained until June 2, 2022.\\n\\n       A short time after being discharged home, however, decedent was readmitted to the\\nhospital, where he was diagnosed with episodic memory loss and dangerously-low blood pressure.\\nThe record is not a model of clarity, but it appears that, at some point shortly after this visit,\\ndecedent was discharged to a nursing home, where he remained until July 7, 2022.\\n\\n        It was during decedent\\u2019s stay at the nursing home that Michael first visited decedent on\\nJuly 2. Michael did not visit decedent at any point before July 2, despite knowing that decedent\\nwas in and out of the hospital. Michael justified his absence by explaining that he visited decedent\\nwhen decedent called him, which was in July. Despite his absence, Michael testified that he had\\na close relationship with decedent. Others, however, testified that the two generally disliked each\\nother. Regardless, Michael testified that, when decedent called him in July, Michael went to visit\\nhim, and after decedent was discharged, Michael would occasionally pick up decedent from his\\nhome to go out to lunch.\\n\\n        On July 11, 2022, Michael drove decedent to the police station, where decedent filed a\\nreport alleging that his daughter, McBurrows-Sherrod, was mismanaging his money and failed to\\ntake care of him. There was and still is no evidence to support this accusation. Nevertheless,\\ndecedent believed it, and due to his continuing concern about McBurrows-Sherrod\\u2019s handling of\\nhis money, decedent asked Michael to take decedent to DMCU on July 13, 2022, so that decedent\\ncould remove McBurrows-Sherrod\\u2019s access to decedent\\u2019s account there. Michael agreed.\\n\\n        When the two arrived at DMCU on July 13, Michael pushed decedent\\u2019s wheelchair to the\\noffice of the branch manager, Leah Lindsay. Michael stayed in Lindsay\\u2019s office with decedent\\nand Lindsay while decedent conducted his business, but Michael stayed mostly silent. Decedent\\nasked Lindsay to remove McBurrows-Sherrod\\u2019s power of attorney for decedent and to revoke her\\naccess to decedent\\u2019s accounts, voicing his ongoing concern about McBurrows-Sherrod\\u2019s handling\\nof decedent\\u2019s finances. Lindsay suggested that decedent resolve his concern by simply opening a\\nnew account, and decedent agreed. Decedent named Michael as the beneficiary for this new\\naccount. After the new account was created, the funds from decedent\\u2019s old account were\\ntransferred to his new account. Michael did not tell McBurrows-Sherrod or anyone else in the\\nfamily about either this trip to DMCU or the trip to the police station. He explained that he felt\\nthat he needed to keep the trips a secret because decedent told Michael that he was the only person\\nthat decedent could trust. Michael later took decedent to DMCU a second time because, when\\ndecedent created his new account, decedent\\u2019s driver\\u2019s license was expired, and he needed to\\nprovide a valid one. On this second trip to DMCU, Michael did not go into the bank with decedent.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                -2-\\n\\f        On July 17, 2022\\u2014four days after creating the new DMCU account\\u2014decedent was\\nreadmitted to the hospital, and his records from that visit noted that decedent\\u2019s memory was\\nimpaired. Dr. Anthony Martin, decedent\\u2019s treating physician, opined that decedent\\u2019s cognitive\\nissue was likely caused by a lack of oxygen to decedent\\u2019s brain. Dr. Martin explained that, when\\ndecedent was discharged in early July, he was given at-home treatment instructions to ensure\\nproper blood flow (like wrapping his legs), but if decedent did not comply with his treatment plan,\\nthe result was a lack of oxygen to decedent\\u2019s brain, affecting his cognitive abilities. In subsequent\\nvisits decedent had with Dr. Martin, Dr. Martin noted continuing issues with decedent\\u2019s cognitive\\nfunctions. When decedent was placed on oxygen during those visits, his confusion dissipated.\\n\\n       Decedent passed away on October 3, 2022. Lindsay testified that Michael called her on\\nOctober 4 to inform her of decedent\\u2019s death, and to start the process of closing decedent\\u2019s DMCU\\naccount and sending the funds to Michael as the beneficiary.\\n\\n        Shortly thereafter, McBurrows-Sherrod filed an emergency ex parte motion seeking to\\nenjoin Michael from withdrawing any funds from the DMCU account, which the trial court\\ngranted. This litigation seeking to settle ownership of the DMCU account ensued. Eventually, the\\nlower court held a bench trial to determine whether Michael unduly influenced decedent to name\\nhim the beneficiary of the DMCU account. At the close of the trial, the court held that McBurrows-\\nSherrod established a presumption of undue influence and that Michael\\u2019s rebuttal evidence was\\n\\u201cmuch weaker evidence than the evidence offered to support the presumption of undue influence,\\u201d\\nso the court found by a preponderance of the evidence that Michael unduly influenced decedent to\\nname Michael the beneficiary of decedent\\u2019s DMCU account.\\n\\n       This appeal followed.\\n\\n                         II.

BACKGROUND\\n\\n        On August 10, 2023, petitioner filed a petition pursuant to MCL 712A.2(b)(1) (neglect or\\nrefusal to provide proper or necessary support, education, medical, surgical, or other care for the\\nchildren) and MCL 712A.2(b)(2) (an unfit home or environment because of neglect, cruelty,\\ndrunkenness, criminality, or depravity on the part of a parent). Petitioner asserted that one of the\\nfive minor children tested positive at birth for cocaine, opiates, amphetamine, methamphetamine,\\nand THC, and that respondents medically neglected a sixth minor child, who was found dead in\\nhis crib after his trach tube had become detached and he was not connected to his pulse oximeter.\\nFurther, respondents\\u2019 \\u201chome\\u2019s condition was neglectful\\u201d and \\u201csuspected drugs were observed\\nsitting on the counter in the apartment.\\u201d Respondents also had a history of substantiated\\ninvestigations by Children\\u2019s Protective Services (CPS).

Marijuana-related\\n\\u201cthings\\u201d were also found in the home. Respondents were asked to complete a drug screen, but\\nrespondents refused unless obligated to do so.\\n\\n        Evidence was presented from CPS and DHS workers who told of prior court interventions\\nwith the family.1 However, the workers who testified to prior interactions testified that the family\\nhad corrected their behavior to such a degree that the cases were closed as the minor children were\\nall healthy.

STANDARD OF REVIEW\\n\\n         \\u201cWe review the trial court\\u2019s decision to exercise jurisdiction for clear error in light of the\\ncourt\\u2019s findings of fact.\\u201d In re BZ, 264 Mich App 286, 295; 690 NW2d 505 (2004). \\u201cA finding\\nis clearly erroneous if, although there is evidence to support it, we are left with a definite and firm\\nconviction that a mistake has been made.\\u201d In re HRC, 286 Mich App 444, 459; 781 NW2d 105\\n(2009) (quotation marks and citation omitted).\\n\\n               III. JURISDICTION PURSUANT TO MCL 712A.2(b)(1) AND (2)\\n\\n        Petitioner asserts that the trial court erred by not acknowledging that a preponderance of\\nthe evidence indicated that respondents demonstrated negligence in their care of their deceased\\nchild. Furthermore, petitioner highlights that respondents have previously been subject to\\ninvestigations by Children\\u2019s Protective Services, thereby invoking the anticipatory-neglect\\ndoctrine in this context. Additionally, petitioner argues that the state of the respondents\\u2019 apartment\\nprovided adequate grounds for the trial court to establish jurisdiction.\\n\\n        \\u201cChild protective proceedings consist of two distinct phases: the trial, also known as the\\nadjudicative phase, and the dispositional phase.\\u201d In re Utrera, 281 Mich App 1, 15; 761 NW2d\\n253 (2008). The adjudicative phase, which occurs first, is when the \\u201ctrial court determines whether\\nit may exercise jurisdiction over the minor child pursuant to MCL 712A.2(b).\\u201d Id. at 16. \\u201cTo\\nproperly exercise jurisdiction, the trial court must find that a statutory basis for jurisdiction exists.\\u201d\\nIn re BZ, 264 Mich App at 295. The relevant statute, MCL 712A.2, \\u201cspeaks in the present tense,\\nand, therefore, the trial court must examine the child\\u2019s situation at the time the petition was filed.\\u201d\\nIn re MU, 264 Mich App 270, 279; 690 NW2d 495 (2004). \\u201cDuring the adjudicative phase, a trial\\nmay be held to determine whether any of the statutory grounds alleged in the petition have been\\nproven.\\u201d In re AMAC, 269 Mich App 533, 536; 711 NW2d 426 (2006).\\n\\n        \\u201cJurisdiction must be established by a preponderance of the evidence.\\u201d In re BZ, 264 Mich\\nApp at 295. A \\u201cpreponderance of the evidence\\u201d means evidence of a proposition that when\\nweighed against the evidence opposed to the proposition \\u201chas more convincing force and the\\ngreater probability of truth.\\u201d People v Cross, 281 Mich App 737, 740; 760 NW2d 314 (2008). \\u201cIf\\nthe court acquires jurisdiction over the child, the dispositional phase follows, at which the trial\\ncourt determines what action, if any, will be taken on behalf of the child.\\u201d In re Utrera, 281 Mich\\nApp at 16 (quotation marks and citation omitted).\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                   -3-\\n\\f       In pertinent part, MCL 712A.2 states:\\n\\n              (b) Jurisdiction in proceedings concerning a juvenile under 18 years of age\\n       found within the county:\\n\\n               (1) Whose parent or other person legally responsible for the care and\\n       maintenance of the juvenile, when able to do so, neglects or refuses to provide\\n       proper or necessary support, education, medical, surgical, or other care necessary\\n       for his or her health or morals, who is subject to a substantial risk of harm to his or\\n       her mental well-being, who is abandoned by his or her parents, guardian, or other\\n       custodian, or who is without proper custody or guardianship. . . .\\n\\n                                               * * *\\n\\n               (2) Whose home or environment, by reason of neglect, cruelty,\\n       drunkenness, criminality, or depravity on the part of a parent, guardian, nonparent\\n       adult, or other custodian, is an unfit place for the juvenile to live in. As used in this\\n       sub-subdivision, \\u201cneglect\\u201d means that term as defined in section 2 of the child abuse\\n       and neglect prevention act, 1982 PA 250, MCL 722.602.\\n\\nFor jurisdiction to be established pursuant to MCL 712A.2(b)(2), there must be allegations, and a\\npreponderance of the evidence supporting, that a respondent\\u2019s home is an unfit place for the minor\\nchild to live. In re Long, 326 Mich App 455, 461; 927 NW2d 724 (2018).\\n\\n         \\u201cIn cases with multiple children, the doctrine of anticipatory neglect may apply to confer\\njurisdiction.\\u201d In re Kellogg, 331 Mich App 249, 259; 952 NW2d 544 (2020), citing In re BZ, 264\\nMich App at 296. \\u201cThe doctrine of anticipatory neglect recognizes that [h]ow a parent treats one\\nchild is certainly probative of how that parent may treat other children.\\u201d In re AH, 245 Mich App\\n77, 84; 627 NW2d 33 (2001) (quotation marks and citation omitted; emphasis added). \\u201cThis\\ndoctrine inherently acknowledges that no actual detrimental act has occurred.\\u201d In re Christie, 339\\nMich App 1, 6; 981 NW2d 172 (2021). \\u201cAbuse or neglect of the second child is not a prerequisite\\nfor jurisdiction of that child and application of the doctrine of anticipatory neglect.\\u201d In re Gazella,\\n264 Mich App 668, 680-681; 692 NW2d 708 (2005), superseded in part on other grounds In re\\nHansen, 285 Mich App 158, 163; 774 NW2d 698 (2009). \\u201cYet, even though jurisdiction may be\\nproperly assumed on the basis of the anticipatory-neglect doctrine, that does not also mean that it\\nwill always be sufficient.\\u201d In re Kellogg, 331 Mich App at 259. The anticipatory-neglect doctrine\\nallows for an inference that a parent\\u2019s treatment of one child is probative of how that parent might\\ntreat other children, but \\u201cthe probative value of such an inference is decreased by differences\\nbetween the children, such as age and medical conditions.\\u201d Id.\\n\\n        Relative to MCL 712A.2(b)(2), the record is clear that petitioner did not provide substantial\\nevidence or expert testimony to demonstrate that the respondents\\u2019 residence was an unsuitable\\nenvironment for a minor child. As referenced in In re Long, 326 Mich App at 461, the only\\nevidence presented by the petitioner indicated that the apartment was cluttered, which does not\\nsatisfy the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard. Accordingly, the trial court was correct in\\nconcluding that the petitioner failed to meet its burden of proof.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                 -4-\\n\\f        Relative to MCL 712A.2(b)(1), the evidence submitted by the petitioner was limited solely\\nto the decedent\\u2019s medical needs, the medical care received, and the cause of death. There was a\\nnotable absence of evidence regarding the care and living conditions of the other minor children\\ninvolved in this case. Additionally, the anticipatory-neglect doctrine is not convincingly applicable\\nhere, especially given the significant medical needs of the decedent rather than those of the other\\nchildren.\\n        As it pertains to MCL 712A.2(b)(1), petitioner only presented evidence regarding the\\ndecedent\\u2019s medical needs, medical care, and cause of death. Petitioner failed to present any\\nevidence regarding the care or conditions of the other minor children in this matter. Furthermore,\\nthe anticipatory-neglect doctrine is not persuasive in this matter, given the significant medical\\nneeds that the decedent had, and no evidence was presented establishing that any of the other minor\\nchildren had the same required level of care. The anticipatory-neglect doctrine is not an absolute\\nmethod for establishing jurisdiction; instead, it is a permissible inference whose weight may shift\\nconsiderably depending on the facts in a given matter. In this case, given the lack of evidence\\npresented by petitioner, the trial court had no other choice than to attribute very little weight to the\\nanticipatory-neglect doctrine, and the trial court did not clearly err by doing so.

The anticipatory-neglect doctrine\\nallows for an inference that a parent\\u2019s treatment of one child is probative of how that parent might\\ntreat other children, but \\u201cthe probative value of such an inference is decreased by differences\\nbetween the children, such as age and medical conditions.\\u201d Id.\\n\\n        Relative to MCL 712A.2(b)(2), the record is clear that petitioner did not provide substantial\\nevidence or expert testimony to demonstrate that the respondents\\u2019 residence was an unsuitable\\nenvironment for a minor child.

Accordingly, the trial court was correct in\\nconcluding that the petitioner failed to meet its burden of proof.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                 -4-\\n\\f        Relative to MCL 712A.2(b)(1), the evidence submitted by the petitioner was limited solely\\nto the decedent\\u2019s medical needs, the medical care received, and the cause of death. There was a\\nnotable absence of evidence regarding the care and living conditions of the other minor children\\ninvolved in this case. Additionally, the anticipatory-neglect doctrine is not convincingly applicable\\nhere, especially given the significant medical needs of the decedent rather than those of the other\\nchildren.\\n        As it pertains to MCL 712A.2(b)(1), petitioner only presented evidence regarding the\\ndecedent\\u2019s medical needs, medical care, and cause of death. Petitioner failed to present any\\nevidence regarding the care or conditions of the other minor children in this matter. Furthermore,\\nthe anticipatory-neglect doctrine is not persuasive in this matter, given the significant medical\\nneeds that the decedent had, and no evidence was presented establishing that any of the other minor\\nchildren had the same required level of care. The anticipatory-neglect doctrine is not an absolute\\nmethod for establishing jurisdiction; instead, it is a permissible inference whose weight may shift\\nconsiderably depending on the facts in a given matter. In this case, given the lack of evidence\\npresented by petitioner, the trial court had no other choice than to attribute very little weight to the\\nanticipatory-neglect doctrine, and the trial court did not clearly err by doing so.

Around the same time, defendant stopped putting money into the MCAC account that\\nplaintiff had access to, so she could no longer withdraw the $450 per week that she was previously\\nusing to pay her expenses. This caused plaintiff to file an emergency motion asking the trial court\\nto order defendant to continue making payments to plaintiff to maintain the status quo. The trial\\ncourt granted plaintiff\\u2019s motion and entered a status-quo order on May 2, 2022.\\n\\n        Defendant failed to comply with the status-quo order, causing plaintiff to file two show-\\ncause motions in June 2022 and October 2022. In response to both motions, defendant claimed\\nthat he could not afford to make the ordered payments in part because MCAC temporarily closed\\n\\n\\n1\\n  Treadway v Treadway, unpublished order of the Court of Appeals, entered October 2, 2024\\n(Docket Nos. 367051 and 368614).\\n\\n\\n                                                -1-\\n\\fa month after the divorce proceedings began. MCAC reopened at a new location, and defendant\\ncontinued running the business without plaintiff\\u2019s involvement. In November 2022, defendant\\nmoved to amend the status-quo order, arguing that, since the order was entered, plaintiff had gained\\nemployment and her live-in boyfriend was paying some of her household expenses. The trial court\\nrefused to grant defendant\\u2019s motion to modify the status-quo order because defendant was not\\nmaking his payments under the order.\\n\\n        The case proceeded to trial over several days in April and May 2023, and the trial court\\nheard closing arguments and issued a ruling from the bench on June 1, 2023. Addressing\\ndefendant\\u2019s failure to make payments under the status-quo order, the court noted that defendant\\nowed more than $30,000 under the order, but it decided to only require defendant to pay $20,000\\nof that amount. As for the marital estate, the parties\\u2019 significant assets included plaintiff\\u2019s\\npremarital home (the 921 Carroll Street property); defendant\\u2019s premarital home (the River Road\\nproperty); a property the parties acquired during the marriage (the 918 Carroll Street property); a\\nhorse trailer; MCAC; a Ford truck that defendant drove; and a Chevy truck and Chrysler Sebring\\nthat plaintiff drove. The trial court ruled that plaintiff would keep the 921 Carroll Street property,\\nthe horse trailer, the Chevy truck, and the Chrysler Sebring; defendant would keep MCAC, the\\nRiver Road property, and the Ford truck; and the parties would sell the 918 Carroll Street property\\nand split the proceeds equally. The trial court also ordered defendant to pay plaintiff $8,000 in\\nattorney fees because (1) plaintiff was unable to bear the cost of litigation and (2) defendant\\nunreasonably prolonged the litigation by failing to negotiate in good faith and refusing to comply\\nwith the status-quo order.\\n\\n        After trial concluded, defendant discovered that MCAC\\u2019s outstanding tax liability was\\nsignificantly higher than the parties believed it to be during trial. Having already appealed the\\njudgment of divorce, defendant filed a motion to remand so that he could move for relief from\\njudgment in the trial court. This Court granted defendant\\u2019s motion. Treadway v Treadway,\\nunpublished order of the Court of Appeals, entered April 11, 2024 (Docket No. 376051).\\n\\n       On remand, defendant argued that he was entitled to relief from judgment under MCR\\n2.612(C)(1)(b) and (f) on the basis of MCAC\\u2019s newly-discovered tax liability. The trial court\\ndenied defendant\\u2019s motion, reasoning that defendant failed to satisfy the requirements of either\\nrule. The case now returns to this Court for plenary review.\\n\\n                                  II. DIVISION OF PROPERTY\\n\\n       Defendant first argues that the trial court erred by awarding plaintiff a greater portion of\\nthe marital estate. We disagree.\\n\\n        A trial court\\u2019s dispositional ruling should be \\u201cfair and equitable in light of the trial court\\u2019s\\nfindings of fact,\\u201d and this is reviewed for clear error, meaning that \\u201cthis Court will reverse only if\\ndefinitely and firmly convinced that the disposition is inequitable.\\u201d Woodington v Shokoohi, 288\\nMich App 352, 365; 792 NW2d 63 (2010). A trial court\\u2019s factual findings supporting its\\ndispositional ruling are likewise reviewed for clear error. Cunningham v Cunningham, 289 Mich\\nApp 195, 200; 795 NW2d 826 (2010). A finding is clearly erroneous if the reviewing court is left\\nwith a definite and firm conviction that the trial court made a mistake. Id.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                  -2-\\n\\f         Before dividing the marital estate, the trial court must decide \\u201cwhat property is marital and\\nwhat property is separate.\\u201d Id. \\u201cGenerally, marital property is that which is acquired or earned\\nduring the marriage, whereas separate property is that which is obtained or earned before the\\nmarriage.\\u201d Id. at 201. Each party is generally awarded their separate property without invasion\\nby the other party, while the marital property is apportioned between the parties \\u201cin a manner that\\nis equitable in light of all the cirumstances.\\u201d Id. The trial court\\u2019s goal when dividing the marital\\nestate is to achieve an equitable distribution of property, not necessarily an equal one. Nalevayko\\nv Nalevayko, 198 Mich App 163, 164; 497 NW2d 533 (1993).\\n\\n        The trial court here ordered that the parties each keep the real property that they entered\\nthe marriage with as well as the vehicles that each used. This meant that plaintiff kept the 921\\nCarroll Street property, the Chevy truck, and the Chrysler Sebring, while defendant kept the River\\nRoad property and the Ford truck. The trial court also awarded each party the marital assets that\\nthey utilized\\u2014it awarded plaintiff the horse trailer because she was the one who used the trailer,\\nand it awarded defendant MCAC because defendant ran the business without plaintiff after the\\ncouple separated. As for the 918 Carroll Street property, the court ordered that it be sold and that\\nthe parties split the proceeds from the sale equally. On its face, this award appears both reasonable\\nand equitable\\u2014the parties were each awarded (1) the property that they entered the marriage with,\\n(2) the vehicles they used, and (3) the valuable assets that they utilized.\\n\\n         Defendant assails this division of property for a number of reasons. First, he contends that\\nthe trial court\\u2019s award does not account for the fact that the $35,000 that defendant paid to acquire\\nMCAC was separate property because defendant made this investment before the parties were\\nmarried. The trial court rejected defendant\\u2019s argument that his initial investment in MCAC was\\nseparate property because the court found that MCAC had since become a marital asset. This\\nfinding was not clearly erroneous, as the record supports that MCAC became a marital asset after\\ndefendant made plaintiff a joint owner and the two ran the business together, treating it as marital\\nproperty. See Cunningham, 289 Mich App at 201 (explaining that a separate asset may lose its\\ncharacter as separate proeprty when it is commingled with marital assets and treated as marital\\nproperty). The $35,000 investment that defendant made to acquire MCAC lost any character it\\nhad as separate property when MCAC itself became marital property. The trial court therefore did\\nnot err by refusing to treat defendant\\u2019s initial $35,000 investment in MCAC as separate property.\\n\\n        Second, defendant contests the trial court\\u2019s valuation of MCAC at $90,000, but his\\nargument is specious. Defendant criticizes the trial court for arriving at the $90,000 figure\\n\\u201cwithout expert testimony,\\u201d but the lack of expert testimony on this point is the fault of the parties,\\nnot the trial court. The trial court had to rule on the record that was presented to it, and that record\\ndid not contain any expert testimony. What the record did contain was the parties\\u2019 testimony that\\nMCAC was purchased for $75,000, defendant\\u2019s testimony that he purchased $26,000 worth of\\ntools for MCAC, and plaintiff\\u2019s testimony that the tools purchased for MCAC retained a value of\\n$15,000. On the basis of this evidence, the trial court\\u2019s finding that MCAC was worth $90,000\\nwas reasonable, particularly given the lack of evidence supporting a different valuation.\\n\\n        Third, and finally, defendant complains that the trial court\\u2019s property distribution was\\ninequitable because it favored plaintiff due to the fact that the trial court awarded plaintiff the 921\\nCarroll Street property without awarding defendant any of the appreciated value of the property.\\nDefendant\\u2019s argument is grounded in the legal principle that a spouse is entitled to \\u201cany increase\\u201d\\n\\n\\n                                                  -3-\\n\\fin the value of a separate asset \\u201cover the term of a marriage\\u201d because that \\u201camount is clearly part\\nof the marital estate.\\u201d Reeves v Reeves, 226 Mich App 490, 495; 575 NW2d 1 (1997). While it is\\ntrue that the trial court\\u2019s award significantly favored plaintiff due to the value of the 921 Carroll\\nStreet property and the fact that the trial court awarded plaintiff that property outright, we are not\\ndefinitely and firmly convinced that the court\\u2019s dispositional ruling was inequitable.\\n\\n        Every asset that the trial court awarded to a party was awarded outright\\u2014the trial court\\nawarded plaintiff the 921 Carroll Street property without awarding defendant any of the property\\u2019s\\nappreciated value in the same way that the court awarded defendant the River Road property\\nwithout awarding plaintiff any of that property\\u2019s appreciated value.2 While this ended up favoring\\nplaintiff because the 921 Carroll Street property appreciated more than the River Road property,\\nthe main reason that the 921 Carroll Street property appreciated more is because it was worth more\\nwhen the parties married. That is, the larger increase in value of the 921 Carroll Street property\\nwas due to plaintiff\\u2019s investment in a more valuable property, not to actions taken during the\\nmarriage.3\\n\\n        Defendant insists that the trial court\\u2019s award was inequitable because it did not account for\\nthe fact that the parties used marital funds to pay off a roughly $30,000 mortgage that was\\nencumbering the 921 Carroll Street property. This argument, however, overlooks evidence in the\\nrecord suggesting that defendant used funds he earned during the marriage\\u2014that is, marital\\nfunds\\u2014to make payments on a mortgage for the River Road property. Those mortgage payments\\nthat increased defendant\\u2019s equity in the River Road property were never considered to plaintiff\\u2019s\\nbenefit just as the mortgage payments that increased plaintiff\\u2019s equity in the 921 Carroll Street\\nproperty were never considered to defendant\\u2019s benefit.\\n\\n        The foregoing shows that the trial court treated the real property that each party came into\\nthe marriage with the same\\u2014each party left the marriage with the real property that they came into\\nthe marriage with, and neither party was awarded any interest in the appreciation in value of the\\nother\\u2019s property. The result of dividing the property in this way was an unequal division of the\\nmarital estate, but we are not definitely and firmly convinced that dividing the marital estate in a\\nway that treated the parties\\u2019 respective properties the same was inequitable. This is especially so\\nbecause the trial court somewhat balanced the unequal distribution of the parties\\u2019 real property by\\nawarding defendant the parties\\u2019 revenue-generating asset\\u2014MCAC\\u2014without awarding plaintiff\\nanything for her stake in the company. While defendant questions the trial court\\u2019s $90,000\\nvaluation of MCAC, the court itself believed that the $90,000 figure was \\u201cconservative[]\\u201d because\\nit did not include the $200,000 land contract that MCAC signed for its current location. We tend\\nto agree with the trial court on this point, and that reasoning further supports that the court\\u2019s\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n Defendant does not contest that the amount that the River Road property appreciated during the\\nparties\\u2019 marriage was a marital asset.\\n3\\n  Though some improvements were made to the 921 Carroll Street property during the marriage,\\nthere is no evidence establishing to what extent, if any, those improvements increased the value of\\nthe property.\\n\\n\\n                                                 -4-\\n\\fdistribution of the marital estate was \\u201cequitable in light of all the circumstances.\\u201d Cunningham,\\n289 Mich App at 200.\\n\\n       For these reasons, we are not definitely and firmly convinced that the trial court\\u2019s division\\nof the marital estate was inequitable, so we affirm that portion of the lower court\\u2019s ruling.\\nWoodington, 288 Mich App at 365.\\n\\n                                    III. STATUS-QUO ORDER\\n\\n        Defendant next challenges the trial court\\u2019s order that defendant pay plaintiff $20,000 for\\nmoney he owed under the trial court\\u2019s status-quo order. That order was the result of an emergency\\nmotion filed by plaintiff on March 25, 2022. Plaintiff\\u2019s emergency motion asked the court to order\\ndefendant to pay plaintiff $450 per week, claiming that plaintiff had been taking this amount out\\nof the couples\\u2019 MCAC account before she filed for divorce and that, since plaintiff filed for\\ndivorce, defendant stopped putting money into that account, so plaintiff no longer had any money\\n\\u201cto pay her bills.\\u201d Defendant objected to plaintiff\\u2019s motion, and the trial court heard argument on\\nApril 7, 2022. At the hearing, plaintiff\\u2019s counsel represented that, besides withholding money\\nfrom the couples\\u2019 joint account, defendant had stopped making payments for plaintiff\\u2019s truck,\\nwhich he had been doing before plaintiff filed for divorce. At the conclusion of the hearing, the\\ntrial court ordered that defendant pay plaintiff $450 per week and make the payments for plaintiff\\u2019s\\ntruck in order to maintain the status quo until the parties\\u2019 divorce was finalized. The court\\nmemorialized this ruling in a May 2, 2022 order. That order required defendant to pay plaintiff\\n$450 per week and \\u201cpay the Plaintiff\\u2019s pick-up truck payment until the divorce is final.\\u201d The order\\nstated that plaintiff was able to access $2,000 since she filed for divorce, so defendant was only\\nrequired to pay $250 \\u201cfor the week of April 12, 2022,\\u201d and was thereafter required to pay $450\\nper week until the divorce was finalized.\\n\\n        Despite largely failing to comply with this order, defendant moved to modify the status-\\nquo order in November 2022. The trial court held a hearing on defendant\\u2019s motion in January\\n2023, and after learning that defendant was still not making the payments required of him by the\\nstatus-quo order, the court refused to grant defendant\\u2019s motion, reasoning, \\u201cYou can\\u2019t come in and\\nsay, you know, I need relief from this order that I\\u2019m not complying with anyway.\\u201d\\n\\n         Following this hearing, defendant continued to not comply with the status-quo order, so by\\nthe time the trial court issued its ruling on June 1, 2023, defendant owed plaintiff over $30,000\\nunder the order. In its June 1 ruling, though, the trial court stated that it would reduce the amount\\nthat defendant owed under the order to $20,000. The court\\u2019s ruling that defendant pay plaintiff\\n$20,000 for arrears owed under the status-quo order was incorporated into the judgment of divorce,\\nand it is that $20,000 required payment that defendant now challenges on appeal.\\n\\n        Defendant contends that \\u201cwithout knowing the basis of the trial court\\u2019s ruling, the trial\\ncourt erred in ruling that [defendant] was obligated to [plaintiff] in the amount of $20,000.\\u201d But\\nwe do know \\u201cthe basis\\u201d for the trial court\\u2019s ruling\\u2014it is the May 2, 2022 status-quo order. That\\norder required defendant to pay plaintiff $450 per week and to make the monthly payments for\\nplaintiff\\u2019s truck. Defendant largely refused to follow this order and, as a result, owed plaintiff over\\n$30,000, and the court ordered that defendant only had to pay $20,000 of that amount.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                 -5-\\n\\f        Defendant complains that the trial court did not explain the factual basis on which it relied\\nto reach the $20,000 figure, but that is because defendant did not owe $20,000 under the status-\\nquo order\\u2014he owed over $30,000. While the trial court reduced that amount to $20,000, this does\\nnot change the fact that defendant owed over $30,000 for payments required by the status-quo\\norder.\\n\\n         Defendant insists that the status-quo order became improper after plaintiff obtained\\nemployment, and her boyfriend moved in with her and provided some financial support. We agree\\nwith defendant in that, given these changes to plaintiff\\u2019s financial situation, the trial court could\\nhave modified the status-quo order. That said, we cannot agree with defendant to the extent he\\nargues that such changes required the court to modify the status-quo order. The status-quo order\\nwas a temporary order entered under MCR 3.207(C), and Subsection (3) of that rule provides, \\u201cA\\ntemporary order may be modified at any time during the pendency of the case, following a hearing\\nand upon a showing of good cause.\\u201d MCR 3.207(C)(3). The court rule\\u2019s use of \\u201cmay\\u201d establishes\\nthat a trial court has discretion to modify a temporary order, even if a party establishes good cause\\nto do so. See Lashbrook v Grasak, ___ Mich App ___, ___; ___ NW3d ___ (2025) (Docket No.\\n369669); slip op at 4 (holding that a court rule\\u2019s use of \\u201cmay\\u201d establishes that the rule is\\ndiscretionary). Defendant does not explain how the trial court\\u2019s refusal to grant defendant\\u2019s\\nmotion amounted to an abuse of discretion under the circumstances, thereby abandoning the\\nargument. See id. at 5, n 4 (explaining that a party abandons an argument \\u201c[b]y failing to address\\u201d\\nit).\\n\\n         But even if we addressed the issue, we would still conclude that defendant was not entitled\\nto appellate relief. The trial court reasoned that it was not going to relieve defendant of his\\nobligations under the status-quo order while defendant was refusing to comply with those\\nobligations, regardless of any changes to the parties\\u2019 financial situations. The court later elaborated\\nthat its refusal to grant defendant\\u2019s motion was also based on the court\\u2019s belief that defendant was\\nnot being truthful when he claimed that he did not have the money to satisfy his obligations under\\nthe status-quo order because, during that same time, defendant had enough money to move MCAC\\nto a new location. The court\\u2019s refusal to grant defendant relief from an order that defendant was\\nrefusing to follow despite having the ability to do so was not outside the range of reasonable and\\nprincipled outcomes, so it did not constitute an abuse of discretion. See Zalewski v Zalewski, 342\\nMich App 429, 433; 995 NW2d 553 (2022) (explaining that a trial court abuses its discretion if it\\nchooses an outcome that falls outside the range of reasonable and principled outcomes).\\n\\n       For these reasons, we discern no error with the trial court\\u2019s handling of the status-quo order.\\n\\n                                 IV. RELIEF FROM JUDGMENT\\n\\n         Next, defendant argues that the trial court abused its discretion by denying his motion for\\nrelief from judgment. We disagree.\\n\\n        A trial court\\u2019s denial of a motion for relief from judgment is reviewed for an abuse of\\ndiscretion. CD Barnes Assoc, Inc v Star Heaven, LLC, 300 Mich App 389, 422; 834 NW2d 878\\n(2013). A trial court abuses its discretion when it chooses an outcome that falls \\u201coutside the range\\nof principled outcomes.\\u201d Id.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                 -6-\\n\\f        After the trial court issued its ruling, MCAC was assessed tens of thousands of dollars in\\ntaxes for the period spanning from December 2022 to March 2023. Defendant contended that, in\\nlight of this newly-discovered tax liability, he was entitled to relief from the court\\u2019s judgment\\nunder MCR 2.612(C)(1)(b) and (f). Those subsections provide:\\n\\n              (1) On motion and on just terms, the court may relieve a party or the legal\\n       representative of a party from a final judgment, order, or proceeding on the\\n       following grounds:\\n\\n                                               * * *\\n\\n              (b) Newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been\\n       discovered in time to move for a new trial under MCR 2.611(B).\\n\\n                                               * * *\\n\\n            (f) Any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.\\n       [MCR 2.612(C)(1)(b) and (f).]\\n\\n         After a hearing on remand, the trial court denied defendant\\u2019s motion. The court reasoned\\nthat defendant was not entitled to relief under MCR 2.613(C)(1)(b) because MCAC\\u2019s tax debt was\\nnot \\u201cnewly discovered\\u201d as defendant knew or should have known that his business activities were\\nincurring taxes, and he could have discovered the extent of MCAC\\u2019s tax liability by exercising\\ndue diligence. The court added that knowing about MCAC\\u2019s substantial tax liability would not\\nhave changed the court\\u2019s judgment because the court \\u201cassumed\\u201d that MCAC was paying taxes and\\nthat this was accounted for in the parties\\u2019 valuations of the business. On the latter point, the court\\nemphasized that the parties did not present much evidence about MCAC\\u2019s value, forcing the court\\nto make numerous assumptions when determining its value.\\n\\n        Turning to defendant\\u2019s motion under MCR 2.613(C)(1)(f), the court believed that\\ndefendant\\u2019s argument did not fit this subsection because Subsection (f) was only to be used when\\nno other subsection could apply, and the court thought that defendant\\u2019s claim clearly fit under\\nSubsection (b). Assuming that Subsection (f) did apply, the court reasoned that defendant was not\\nentitled to relief under that subsection because plaintiff did not \\u201ccreate this situation\\u201d or \\u201chide\\nevidence\\u201d from defendant, particularly considering that she was not involved with MCAC when\\nthe taxes accrued between December 2022 and March 2023. The court further reasoned that relief\\nwas not appropriate under Subsection (f) because setting aside the judgment would detrimentally\\naffect plaintiff\\u2019s rights, as she would be subjected \\u201cto another trial, and another extended period\\nof discovery or whatever else was going to happen.\\u201d\\n\\n         On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred by denying his motion under MCR\\n2.116(C)(1)(b) because \\u201cthere was nothing in the record to support the Court\\u2019s finding[]\\u201d that\\ndefendant \\u201cshould have been aware of the tax liability.\\u201d Defendant similarly argues that the trial\\ncourt erred by denying his motion under MCR 2.116(C)(1)(f) because nothing in the record\\nsupported that defendant \\u201cshould have been aware of the tax liability and that there was no basis\\nfor relief.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                 -7-\\n\\f        Problematically for defendant, neither argument fully addresses the trial court\\u2019s denial of\\ndefendant\\u2019s motion under either subsection. For Subsection (b), the court did not only reason that\\ndefendant should have been aware of MCAC\\u2019s tax liability; the court also reasoned that its\\njudgment would not have been different even if it knew about MCAC\\u2019s tax liability because the\\ncourt\\u2019s valuation of the company assumed that MCAC, like most companies, was incurring taxes.\\nAnd for the court\\u2019s decision under Subsection (f), the court did not even consider whether\\ndefendant should have been aware of MCAC\\u2019s tax liability\\u2014the court denied defendant\\u2019s motion\\nunder Subsection (f) because it believed that plaintiff did not engage in any improper conduct, and\\nbecause it thought that granting defendant\\u2019s motion would detrimentally affect plaintiff\\u2019s\\nsubstantial rights. By not addressing the actual basis for the trial court\\u2019s rulings, defendant\\nabandoned any argument that the trial court erred by denying his motion for relief from judgment.\\nSee Redmond v Heller, 332 Mich App 415, 449; 957 NW2d 357 (2020); Derderian v Genesys\\nHealth Care Sys, 263 Mich App 364, 381; 689 NW2d 145 (2004).\\n\\n        Putting these fatal defects aside, we disagree with defendant\\u2019s argument that the trial court\\nerred by reasoning that defendant should have known about MCAC\\u2019s tax liability. The trial court\\ndid not need an evidentiary hearing to conclude that a seasoned business owner like defendant\\nshould know that their business incurs taxes. The court believed that, with defendant having this\\nknowledge, he could have discovered the extent of MCAC\\u2019s tax liability through simple due\\ndiligence, like speaking with his accountant or consulting someone to appraise the business as part\\nof the divorce proceedings. See Int\\u2019l Outdoor, Inc v SS Mitx, LLC, ___ Mich App ___, ___; ___\\nNW3d ___ (2023) (Docket Nos. 359082 and 359811); slip op at 4 (explaining that a party moving\\nfor relief from judgment under MCR 2.612(C)(1)(b) must establish that they were \\u201cnot able to\\nproduce the evidence with reasonable diligence\\u201d). This reasoning, in our opinion, is sound.\\n\\n         Even if it were not, we would still affirm because we agree with the other reasons provided\\nby the trial court. The trial court concluded that relief was not proper under MCR 2.612(C)(1)(b)\\nbecause evidence of MCAC\\u2019s tax liability would not have changed the result of trial. See id. at\\n___; slip op at 11 (explaining that a party moving for relief from judgment under MCR\\n2.612(C)(1)(b) must establish that the newly discovered evidence is likely to change the result of\\ntrial). The court explained that, even knowing of MCAC\\u2019s substantial tax liability, the court would\\nhave valued MCAC the same because the court assumed that the parties\\u2019 valuation of the company\\nconsidered the fact that MCAC had incurred and would continue to incur taxes.

For Subsection (a), the court\\nfound that plaintiff \\u201ccould not bear the entire cost of this litigation\\u201d because her attorney fees were\\ninflated \\u201cdue to [defendant\\u2019s] actions\\u201d that prolonged the litigation. Related to the latter point, the\\ncourt found that plaintiff was entitled to attorney fees under MCR 3.206(D)(2)(b) because\\ndefendant \\u201cdid not negotiate in good faith,\\u201d \\u201cdid not provide information that was available to\\nhim,\\u201d and \\u201cdidn\\u2019t maintain the status quo without making that a difficult process.\\u201d\\n\\n         On appeal, defendant first contests the award under MCR 3.206(D)(2)(a), arguing that the\\ntrial court clearly erred when it found that plaintiff was unable to bear the expense of the litigation.\\nWe agree. Plaintiff\\u2019s counsel submitted a bill for about $15,000, and due to duplicate entries, the\\ncourt reduced the bill to \\u201cabout $12,000 or $13,000\\u201d and ordered defendant to pay $8,000. Based\\non the evidence presented at trial, plaintiff had an annual income of $24,700, she no longer had a\\nmortgage payment, and her boyfriend assisted her with paying her household expenses. This\\nevidence all tends to support that plaintiff was able to bear the expense of litigation. In contrast,\\nthe trial court did not explain why it believed that plaintiff could not afford her attorney fees; the\\n\\n\\n                                                  -9-\\n\\fcourt simply said that the litigation went on too long, which does not support that plaintiff could\\nnot bear the expense of litigation. Plaintiff likewise provided no support for her assertion at the\\nhearing that she \\u201cneeds assistance with this attorney fee situation.\\u201d On this record, we are\\ndefinitely and firmly convinced that the trial court erred by finding that plaintiff could not bear the\\nexpense of the litigation. Consequently, an award of attorney fees was not permissible under MCR\\n3.206(D)(2)(a).\\n\\n        Because the trial court did not specify how much of its $8,000 ordered attorney fees were\\nbeing awarded under Subsection (a) versus Subsection (b), our conclusion that the trial court\\u2019s\\nattorney-fee award was not justified under MCR 3.206(D)(2)(a) requires us to vacate the award of\\nattorney fees and remand for further proceedings. We nevertheless briefly address the trial court\\u2019s\\naward of attorney fees under MCR 3.206(D)(2)(b) because defendant raises the issue on appeal\\nand it will be relevant on remand.\\n\\n        Defendant concedes on appeal that it was not improper for the trial court to award plaintiff\\nattorney fees under MCR 3.206(D)(2)(b) to the extent that the fees were incurred as a result of\\ndefendant\\u2019s refusal to comply with the status-quo order, but he contends that the remainder of the\\nattorney-fee award was improper. We agree with defendant that the trial court was justified in\\nawarding plaintiff attorney fees under MCR 3.206(D)(2)(b) to the extent that the fees were incurred\\nas a result of defendant\\u2019s noncompliance with the status quo order. We also hesitantly agree with\\ndefendant that the remainder of the attorney-fee award was improper. Attorney fees are proper\\nunder MCR 3.206(D)(2)(b) if they were \\u201cincurred because the other party refused to comply with\\na previous court order\\u201d or the other party \\u201cengaged in discovery practices in violation of these\\nrules.\\u201d The trial court reasoned that attorney fees were justified under Subsection (b) in part\\nbecause it found that defendant \\u201cdid not negotiate in good faith\\u201d and \\u201cdid not provide information\\nthat was available to him.\\u201d The court\\u2019s justifications, without more specificity, are insufficient\\u2014\\nthe court did not identify \\u201ca previous court order\\u201d with which defendant refused to comply, nor\\ndid the court explain how defendant\\u2019s conduct amounted to a discovery violation under the court\\nrules. Without satisfying one of those two conditions, an award of attorney fees under MCR\\n3.206(D)(2)(b) is improper. If the trial court on remand believes that attorney fees under MCR\\n3.206(D)(2)(b) are warranted beyond the fees that plaintiff incurred because of defendant\\u2019s refusal\\nto comply with the status-quo order, the court is instructed to clearly identify either the order that\\ndefendant refused to comply with, or the rule that defendant violated with his conduct during\\ndiscovery.4\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4\\n  While not necessarily relevant to the disposition of this case, we agree with defendant that the\\ntrial court clearly erred when it found that defendant claimed that MCAC \\u201cwasn\\u2019t worth anything\\u201d\\nearly on in the litigation. Taking the court\\u2019s assertion at face value, we cannot find any statement\\nin a transcript or filing in the record where defendant asserted that MCAC was worthless. It is\\npossible that the trial court was speaking hyperbolically or even referencing an off-the-record\\nconversation it had with the parties, but either way, the court\\u2019s finding that defendant claimed that\\nMCAC \\u201cwasn\\u2019t worth anything\\u201d was clearly erroneous because it is unsupported by the record.\\n\\n\\n                                                 -10-\\n\\f        Affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded for further proceedings.

BACKGROUND\\n\\n        The parties married in December 2015 but ceased living together in May 2020. While they\\nwere married, the couple ran an automobile-repair business, Marine City Auto Care (MCAC),\\ntogether. After plaintiff commenced this divorce action on March 8, 2022, she stopped working\\nfor MCAC. Around the same time, defendant stopped putting money into the MCAC account that\\nplaintiff had access to, so she could no longer withdraw the $450 per week that she was previously\\nusing to pay her expenses. This caused plaintiff to file an emergency motion asking the trial court\\nto order defendant to continue making payments to plaintiff to maintain the status quo. The trial\\ncourt granted plaintiff\\u2019s motion and entered a status-quo order on May 2, 2022.\\n\\n        Defendant failed to comply with the status-quo order, causing plaintiff to file two show-\\ncause motions in June 2022 and October 2022. In response to both motions, defendant claimed\\nthat he could not afford to make the ordered payments in part because MCAC temporarily closed\\n\\n\\n1\\n  Treadway v Treadway, unpublished order of the Court of Appeals, entered October 2, 2024\\n(Docket Nos. 367051 and 368614).\\n\\n\\n                                                -1-\\n\\fa month after the divorce proceedings began. MCAC reopened at a new location, and defendant\\ncontinued running the business without plaintiff\\u2019s involvement. In November 2022, defendant\\nmoved to amend the status-quo order, arguing that, since the order was entered, plaintiff had gained\\nemployment and her live-in boyfriend was paying some of her household expenses. The trial court\\nrefused to grant defendant\\u2019s motion to modify the status-quo order because defendant was not\\nmaking his payments under the order.\\n\\n        The case proceeded to trial over several days in April and May 2023, and the trial court\\nheard closing arguments and issued a ruling from the bench on June 1, 2023. Addressing\\ndefendant\\u2019s failure to make payments under the status-quo order, the court noted that defendant\\nowed more than $30,000 under the order, but it decided to only require defendant to pay $20,000\\nof that amount. As for the marital estate, the parties\\u2019 significant assets included plaintiff\\u2019s\\npremarital home (the 921 Carroll Street property); defendant\\u2019s premarital home (the River Road\\nproperty); a property the parties acquired during the marriage (the 918 Carroll Street property); a\\nhorse trailer; MCAC; a Ford truck that defendant drove; and a Chevy truck and Chrysler Sebring\\nthat plaintiff drove. The trial court ruled that plaintiff would keep the 921 Carroll Street property,\\nthe horse trailer, the Chevy truck, and the Chrysler Sebring; defendant would keep MCAC, the\\nRiver Road property, and the Ford truck; and the parties would sell the 918 Carroll Street property\\nand split the proceeds equally. The trial court also ordered defendant to pay plaintiff $8,000 in\\nattorney fees because (1) plaintiff was unable to bear the cost of litigation and (2) defendant\\nunreasonably prolonged the litigation by failing to negotiate in good faith and refusing to comply\\nwith the status-quo order.\\n\\n        After trial concluded, defendant discovered that MCAC\\u2019s outstanding tax liability was\\nsignificantly higher than the parties believed it to be during trial. Having already appealed the\\njudgment of divorce, defendant filed a motion to remand so that he could move for relief from\\njudgment in the trial court. This Court granted defendant\\u2019s motion. Treadway v Treadway,\\nunpublished order of the Court of Appeals, entered April 11, 2024 (Docket No. 376051).\\n\\n       On remand, defendant argued that he was entitled to relief from judgment under MCR\\n2.612(C)(1)(b) and (f) on the basis of MCAC\\u2019s newly-discovered tax liability. The trial court\\ndenied defendant\\u2019s motion, reasoning that defendant failed to satisfy the requirements of either\\nrule. The case now returns to this Court for plenary review.\\n\\n                                  II. DIVISION OF PROPERTY\\n\\n       Defendant first argues that the trial court erred by awarding plaintiff a greater portion of\\nthe marital estate. We disagree.\\n\\n        A trial court\\u2019s dispositional ruling should be \\u201cfair and equitable in light of the trial court\\u2019s\\nfindings of fact,\\u201d and this is reviewed for clear error, meaning that \\u201cthis Court will reverse only if\\ndefinitely and firmly convinced that the disposition is inequitable.\\u201d Woodington v Shokoohi, </pre><span class=\\\"citation\\\" data-id=\\\"7960866\\\"><a href=\\\"/opinion/8006260/woodington-v-shokoohi/#365\\\" aria-description=\\\"Citation for case: Woodington v.

This meant that plaintiff kept the 921\\nCarroll Street property, the Chevy truck, and the Chrysler Sebring, while defendant kept the River\\nRoad property and the Ford truck. The trial court also awarded each party the marital assets that\\nthey utilized\\u2014it awarded plaintiff the horse trailer because she was the one who used the trailer,\\nand it awarded defendant MCAC because defendant ran the business without plaintiff after the\\ncouple separated.

First, he contends that\\nthe trial court\\u2019s award does not account for the fact that the $35,000 that defendant paid to acquire\\nMCAC was separate property because defendant made this investment before the parties were\\nmarried. The trial court rejected defendant\\u2019s argument that his initial investment in MCAC was\\nseparate property because the court found that MCAC had since become a marital asset. This\\nfinding was not clearly erroneous, as the record supports that MCAC became a marital asset after\\ndefendant made plaintiff a joint owner and the two ran the business together, treating it as marital\\nproperty. See Cunningham, </pre><span class=\\\"citation\\\" data-id=\\\"7960910\\\"><a href=\\\"/opinion/8006299/cunningham-v-cunningham/#201\\\" aria-description=\\\"Citation for case: Cunningham v.

The $35,000 investment that defendant made to acquire MCAC lost any character it\\nhad as separate property when MCAC itself became marital property. The trial court therefore did\\nnot err by refusing to treat defendant\\u2019s initial $35,000 investment in MCAC as separate property.\\n\\n        Second, defendant contests the trial court\\u2019s valuation of MCAC at $90,000, but his\\nargument is specious. Defendant criticizes the trial court for arriving at the $90,000 figure\\n\\u201cwithout expert testimony,\\u201d but the lack of expert testimony on this point is the fault of the parties,\\nnot the trial court. The trial court had to rule on the record that was presented to it, and that record\\ndid not contain any expert testimony. What the record did contain was the parties\\u2019 testimony that\\nMCAC was purchased for $75,000, defendant\\u2019s testimony that he purchased $26,000 worth of\\ntools for MCAC, and plaintiff\\u2019s testimony that the tools purchased for MCAC retained a value of\\n$15,000. On the basis of this evidence, the trial court\\u2019s finding that MCAC was worth $90,000\\nwas reasonable, particularly given the lack of evidence supporting a different valuation.\\n\\n        Third, and finally, defendant complains that the trial court\\u2019s property distribution was\\ninequitable because it favored plaintiff due to the fact that the trial court awarded plaintiff the 921\\nCarroll Street property without awarding defendant any of the appreciated value of the property.\\nDefendant\\u2019s argument is grounded in the legal principle that a spouse is entitled to \\u201cany increase\\u201d\\n\\n\\n                                                  -3-\\n\\fin the value of a separate asset \\u201cover the term of a marriage\\u201d because that \\u201camount is clearly part\\nof the marital estate.\\u201d Reeves v Reeves, </pre><span class=\\\"citation\\\" data-id=\\\"9676027\\\"><a href=\\\"/opinion/1741866/reeves-v-reeves/#495\\\" aria-description=\\\"Citation for case: Reeves v.

That is, the larger increase in value of the 921 Carroll Street property\\nwas due to plaintiff\\u2019s investment in a more valuable property, not to actions taken during the\\nmarriage.3\\n\\n        Defendant insists that the trial court\\u2019s award was inequitable because it did not account for\\nthe fact that the parties used marital funds to pay off a roughly $30,000 mortgage that was\\nencumbering the 921 Carroll Street property. This argument, however, overlooks evidence in the\\nrecord suggesting that defendant used funds he earned during the marriage\\u2014that is, marital\\nfunds\\u2014to make payments on a mortgage for the River Road property. Those mortgage payments\\nthat increased defendant\\u2019s equity in the River Road property were never considered to plaintiff\\u2019s\\nbenefit just as the mortgage payments that increased plaintiff\\u2019s equity in the 921 Carroll Street\\nproperty were never considered to defendant\\u2019s benefit.\\n\\n        The foregoing shows that the trial court treated the real property that each party came into\\nthe marriage with the same\\u2014each party left the marriage with the real property that they came into\\nthe marriage with, and neither party was awarded any interest in the appreciation in value of the\\nother\\u2019s property. The result of dividing the property in this way was an unequal division of the\\nmarital estate, but we are not definitely and firmly convinced that dividing the marital estate in a\\nway that treated the parties\\u2019 respective properties the same was inequitable. This is especially so\\nbecause the trial court somewhat balanced the unequal distribution of the parties\\u2019 real property by\\nawarding defendant the parties\\u2019 revenue-generating asset\\u2014MCAC\\u2014without awarding plaintiff\\nanything for her stake in the company. While defendant questions the trial court\\u2019s $90,000\\nvaluation of MCAC, the court itself believed that the $90,000 figure was \\u201cconservative[]\\u201d because\\nit did not include the $200,000 land contract that MCAC signed for its current location. We tend\\nto agree with the trial court on this point, and that reasoning further supports that the court\\u2019s\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n Defendant does not contest that the amount that the River Road property appreciated during the\\nparties\\u2019 marriage was a marital asset.\\n3\\n  Though some improvements were made to the 921 Carroll Street property during the marriage,\\nthere is no evidence establishing to what extent, if any, those improvements increased the value of\\nthe property.\\n\\n\\n                                                 -4-\\n\\fdistribution of the marital estate was \\u201cequitable in light of all the circumstances.\\u201d Cunningham,\\n</pre><span class=\\\"citation\\\" data-id=\\\"7960910\\\"><a href=\\\"/opinion/8006299/cunningham-v-cunningham/#200\\\" aria-description=\\\"Citation for case: Cunningham v.

STATUS-QUO ORDER\\n\\n        Defendant next challenges the trial court\\u2019s order that defendant pay plaintiff $20,000 for\\nmoney he owed under the trial court\\u2019s status-quo order. That order was the result of an emergency\\nmotion filed by plaintiff on March 25, 2022. Plaintiff\\u2019s emergency motion asked the court to order\\ndefendant to pay plaintiff $450 per week, claiming that plaintiff had been taking this amount out\\nof the couples\\u2019 MCAC account before she filed for divorce and that, since plaintiff filed for\\ndivorce, defendant stopped putting money into that account, so plaintiff no longer had any money\\n\\u201cto pay her bills.\\u201d Defendant objected to plaintiff\\u2019s motion, and the trial court heard argument on\\nApril 7, 2022. At the hearing, plaintiff\\u2019s counsel represented that, besides withholding money\\nfrom the couples\\u2019 joint account, defendant had stopped making payments for plaintiff\\u2019s truck,\\nwhich he had been doing before plaintiff filed for divorce. At the conclusion of the hearing, the\\ntrial court ordered that defendant pay plaintiff $450 per week and make the payments for plaintiff\\u2019s\\ntruck in order to maintain the status quo until the parties\\u2019 divorce was finalized. The court\\nmemorialized this ruling in a May 2, 2022 order. That order required defendant to pay plaintiff\\n$450 per week and \\u201cpay the Plaintiff\\u2019s pick-up truck payment until the divorce is final.\\u201d The order\\nstated that plaintiff was able to access $2,000 since she filed for divorce, so defendant was only\\nrequired to pay $250 \\u201cfor the week of April 12, 2022,\\u201d and was thereafter required to pay $450\\nper week until the divorce was finalized.\\n\\n        Despite largely failing to comply with this order, defendant moved to modify the status-\\nquo order in November 2022. The trial court held a hearing on defendant\\u2019s motion in January\\n2023, and after learning that defendant was still not making the payments required of him by the\\nstatus-quo order, the court refused to grant defendant\\u2019s motion, reasoning, \\u201cYou can\\u2019t come in and\\nsay, you know, I need relief from this order that I\\u2019m not complying with anyway.\\u201d\\n\\n         Following this hearing, defendant continued to not comply with the status-quo order, so by\\nthe time the trial court issued its ruling on June 1, 2023, defendant owed plaintiff over $30,000\\nunder the order. In its June 1 ruling, though, the trial court stated that it would reduce the amount\\nthat defendant owed under the order to $20,000. The court\\u2019s ruling that defendant pay plaintiff\\n$20,000 for arrears owed under the status-quo order was incorporated into the judgment of divorce,\\nand it is that $20,000 required payment that defendant now challenges on appeal.\\n\\n        Defendant contends that \\u201cwithout knowing the basis of the trial court\\u2019s ruling, the trial\\ncourt erred in ruling that [defendant] was obligated to [plaintiff] in the amount of $20,000.\\u201d But\\nwe do know \\u201cthe basis\\u201d for the trial court\\u2019s ruling\\u2014it is the May 2, 2022 status-quo order. That\\norder required defendant to pay plaintiff $450 per week and to make the monthly payments for\\nplaintiff\\u2019s truck. Defendant largely refused to follow this order and, as a result, owed plaintiff over\\n$30,000, and the court ordered that defendant only had to pay $20,000 of that amount.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                 -5-\\n\\f        Defendant complains that the trial court did not explain the factual basis on which it relied\\nto reach the $20,000 figure, but that is because defendant did not owe $20,000 under the status-\\nquo order\\u2014he owed over $30,000. While the trial court reduced that amount to $20,000, this does\\nnot change the fact that defendant owed over $30,000 for payments required by the status-quo\\norder.\\n\\n         Defendant insists that the status-quo order became improper after plaintiff obtained\\nemployment, and her boyfriend moved in with her and provided some financial support. We agree\\nwith defendant in that, given these changes to plaintiff\\u2019s financial situation, the trial court could\\nhave modified the status-quo order. That said, we cannot agree with defendant to the extent he\\nargues that such changes required the court to modify the status-quo order. The status-quo order\\nwas a temporary order entered under MCR 3.207(C), and Subsection (3) of that rule provides, \\u201cA\\ntemporary order may be modified at any time during the pendency of the case, following a hearing\\nand upon a showing of good cause.\\u201d MCR 3.207(C)(3). The court rule\\u2019s use of \\u201cmay\\u201d establishes\\nthat a trial court has discretion to modify a temporary order, even if a party establishes good cause\\nto do so. See Lashbrook v Grasak, ___ Mich App ___, ___; ___ NW3d ___ (2025) (Docket No.\\n369669); slip op at 4 (holding that a court rule\\u2019s use of \\u201cmay\\u201d establishes that the rule is\\ndiscretionary). Defendant does not explain how the trial court\\u2019s refusal to grant defendant\\u2019s\\nmotion amounted to an abuse of discretion under the circumstances, thereby abandoning the\\nargument. See id. at 5, n 4 (explaining that a party abandons an argument \\u201c[b]y failing to address\\u201d\\nit).\\n\\n         But even if we addressed the issue, we would still conclude that defendant was not entitled\\nto appellate relief. The trial court reasoned that it was not going to relieve defendant of his\\nobligations under the status-quo order while defendant was refusing to comply with those\\nobligations, regardless of any changes to the parties\\u2019 financial situations. The court later elaborated\\nthat its refusal to grant defendant\\u2019s motion was also based on the court\\u2019s belief that defendant was\\nnot being truthful when he claimed that he did not have the money to satisfy his obligations under\\nthe status-quo order because, during that same time, defendant had enough money to move MCAC\\nto a new location. The court\\u2019s refusal to grant defendant relief from an order that defendant was\\nrefusing to follow despite having the ability to do so was not outside the range of reasonable and\\nprincipled outcomes, so it did not constitute an abuse of discretion.

Defendant contended that, in\\nlight of this newly-discovered tax liability, he was entitled to relief from the court\\u2019s judgment\\nunder MCR 2.612(C)(1)(b) and (f). Those subsections provide:\\n\\n              (1) On motion and on just terms, the court may relieve a party or the legal\\n       representative of a party from a final judgment, order, or proceeding on the\\n       following grounds:\\n\\n                                               * * *\\n\\n              (b) Newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been\\n       discovered in time to move for a new trial under MCR 2.611(B).\\n\\n                                               * * *\\n\\n            (f) Any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.\\n       [MCR 2.612(C)(1)(b) and (f).]\\n\\n         After a hearing on remand, the trial court denied defendant\\u2019s motion. The court reasoned\\nthat defendant was not entitled to relief under MCR 2.613(C)(1)(b) because MCAC\\u2019s tax debt was\\nnot \\u201cnewly discovered\\u201d as defendant knew or should have known that his business activities were\\nincurring taxes, and he could have discovered the extent of MCAC\\u2019s tax liability by exercising\\ndue diligence. The court added that knowing about MCAC\\u2019s substantial tax liability would not\\nhave changed the court\\u2019s judgment because the court \\u201cassumed\\u201d that MCAC was paying taxes and\\nthat this was accounted for in the parties\\u2019 valuations of the business. On the latter point, the court\\nemphasized that the parties did not present much evidence about MCAC\\u2019s value, forcing the court\\nto make numerous assumptions when determining its value.\\n\\n        Turning to defendant\\u2019s motion under MCR 2.613(C)(1)(f), the court believed that\\ndefendant\\u2019s argument did not fit this subsection because Subsection (f) was only to be used when\\nno other subsection could apply, and the court thought that defendant\\u2019s claim clearly fit under\\nSubsection (b). Assuming that Subsection (f) did apply, the court reasoned that defendant was not\\nentitled to relief under that subsection because plaintiff did not \\u201ccreate this situation\\u201d or \\u201chide\\nevidence\\u201d from defendant, particularly considering that she was not involved with MCAC when\\nthe taxes accrued between December 2022 and March 2023. The court further reasoned that relief\\nwas not appropriate under Subsection (f) because setting aside the judgment would detrimentally\\naffect plaintiff\\u2019s rights, as she would be subjected \\u201cto another trial, and another extended period\\nof discovery or whatever else was going to happen.\\u201d\\n\\n         On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred by denying his motion under MCR\\n2.116(C)(1)(b) because \\u201cthere was nothing in the record to support the Court\\u2019s finding[]\\u201d that\\ndefendant \\u201cshould have been aware of the tax liability.\\u201d Defendant similarly argues that the trial\\ncourt erred by denying his motion under MCR 2.116(C)(1)(f) because nothing in the record\\nsupported that defendant \\u201cshould have been aware of the tax liability and that there was no basis\\nfor relief.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                 -7-\\n\\f        Problematically for defendant, neither argument fully addresses the trial court\\u2019s denial of\\ndefendant\\u2019s motion under either subsection. For Subsection (b), the court did not only reason that\\ndefendant should have been aware of MCAC\\u2019s tax liability; the court also reasoned that its\\njudgment would not have been different even if it knew about MCAC\\u2019s tax liability because the\\ncourt\\u2019s valuation of the company assumed that MCAC, like most companies, was incurring taxes.\\nAnd for the court\\u2019s decision under Subsection (f), the court did not even consider whether\\ndefendant should have been aware of MCAC\\u2019s tax liability\\u2014the court denied defendant\\u2019s motion\\nunder Subsection (f) because it believed that plaintiff did not engage in any improper conduct, and\\nbecause it thought that granting defendant\\u2019s motion would detrimentally affect plaintiff\\u2019s\\nsubstantial rights. By not addressing the actual basis for the trial court\\u2019s rulings, defendant\\nabandoned any argument that the trial court erred by denying his motion for relief from judgment.\\nSee Redmond v Heller, </pre><span class=\\\"citation no-link\\\">332 Mich App 415</span><pre class=\\\"inline\\\">, 449; </pre><span class=\\\"citation no-link\\\">957 NW2d 357</span><pre class=\\\"inline\\\"> (2020); Derderian v Genesys\\nHealth Care Sys, </pre><span class=\\\"citation\\\" data-id=\\\"2100755\\\"><a href=\\\"/opinion/2100755/derderian-v-genesys-health-care-systems/#381\\\" aria-description=\\\"Citation for case: Derderian v.

Based\\non the evidence presented at trial, plaintiff had an annual income of $24,700, she no longer had a\\nmortgage payment, and her boyfriend assisted her with paying her household expenses. This\\nevidence all tends to support that plaintiff was able to bear the expense of litigation. In contrast,\\nthe trial court did not explain why it believed that plaintiff could not afford her attorney fees; the\\n\\n\\n                                                  -9-\\n\\fcourt simply said that the litigation went on too long, which does not support that plaintiff could\\nnot bear the expense of litigation. Plaintiff likewise provided no support for her assertion at the\\nhearing that she \\u201cneeds assistance with this attorney fee situation.\\u201d On this record, we are\\ndefinitely and firmly convinced that the trial court erred by finding that plaintiff could not bear the\\nexpense of the litigation. Consequently, an award of attorney fees was not permissible under MCR\\n3.206(D)(2)(a).\\n\\n        Because the trial court did not specify how much of its $8,000 ordered attorney fees were\\nbeing awarded under Subsection (a) versus Subsection (b), our conclusion that the trial court\\u2019s\\nattorney-fee award was not justified under MCR 3.206(D)(2)(a) requires us to vacate the award of\\nattorney fees and remand for further proceedings. We nevertheless briefly address the trial court\\u2019s\\naward of attorney fees under MCR 3.206(D)(2)(b) because defendant raises the issue on appeal\\nand it will be relevant on remand.\\n\\n        Defendant concedes on appeal that it was not improper for the trial court to award plaintiff\\nattorney fees under MCR 3.206(D)(2)(b) to the extent that the fees were incurred as a result of\\ndefendant\\u2019s refusal to comply with the status-quo order, but he contends that the remainder of the\\nattorney-fee award was improper. We agree with defendant that the trial court was justified in\\nawarding plaintiff attorney fees under MCR 3.206(D)(2)(b) to the extent that the fees were incurred\\nas a result of defendant\\u2019s noncompliance with the status quo order. We also hesitantly agree with\\ndefendant that the remainder of the attorney-fee award was improper. Attorney fees are proper\\nunder MCR 3.206(D)(2)(b) if they were \\u201cincurred because the other party refused to comply with\\na previous court order\\u201d or the other party \\u201cengaged in discovery practices in violation of these\\nrules.\\u201d The trial court reasoned that attorney fees were justified under Subsection (b) in part\\nbecause it found that defendant \\u201cdid not negotiate in good faith\\u201d and \\u201cdid not provide information\\nthat was available to him.\\u201d The court\\u2019s justifications, without more specificity, are insufficient\\u2014\\nthe court did not identify \\u201ca previous court order\\u201d with which defendant refused to comply, nor\\ndid the court explain how defendant\\u2019s conduct amounted to a discovery violation under the court\\nrules. Without satisfying one of those two conditions, an award of attorney fees under MCR\\n3.206(D)(2)(b) is improper. If the trial court on remand believes that attorney fees under MCR\\n3.206(D)(2)(b) are warranted beyond the fees that plaintiff incurred because of defendant\\u2019s refusal\\nto comply with the status-quo order, the court is instructed to clearly identify either the order that\\ndefendant refused to comply with, or the rule that defendant violated with his conduct during\\ndiscovery.4\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4\\n  While not necessarily relevant to the disposition of this case, we agree with defendant that the\\ntrial court clearly erred when it found that defendant claimed that MCAC \\u201cwasn\\u2019t worth anything\\u201d\\nearly on in the litigation. Taking the court\\u2019s assertion at face value, we cannot find any statement\\nin a transcript or filing in the record where defendant asserted that MCAC was worthless. It is\\npossible that the trial court was speaking hyperbolically or even referencing an off-the-record\\nconversation it had with the parties, but either way, the court\\u2019s finding that defendant claimed that\\nMCAC \\u201cwasn\\u2019t worth anything\\u201d was clearly erroneous because it is unsupported by the record.\\n\\n\\n                                                 -10-\\n\\f        Affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded for further proceedings.

J. KELLY, P.J., and BORRELLO and RICK, JJ.\\n\\nPER CURIAM.\\n\\n         Carlos Andres Sanchez, hereinafter defendant, appeals as of right his convictions by jury\\nof first-degree murder, MCL 750.316(1)(a), and possession of a firearm during the commission of\\na felony (felony-firearm), MCL 750.227b(1). The trial court sentenced defendant to life in prison\\nwithout parole for his murder conviction and a two-year consecutive sentence for his felony\\nfirearm conviction. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm.\\n\\n                                      I. BACKGROUND\\n\\n       This case arises from the murder of Miguel Gutierrez at the residence of Crystal Gonzalez.\\nMs. Gonzalez provided testimony indicating that she had an intermittent relationship with\\ndefendant. Subsequently, she discovered the defendant with another individual, Marissa Garcia,\\nwhich prompted her to engage in a relationship with Gutierrez, who was, notably, Garcia\\u2019s ex-\\nboyfriend in order to \\u201cretaliate\\u201d against defendant.\\n\\n       On the day of the murder, Ms. Gonzalez was present at her trailer in Montague, Michigan,\\nwith Gutierrez, who had been residing there. They were in the process of installing security\\ncameras on the property due to an incident that had damaged Gutierrez\\u2019s vehicle the previous day.\\nMs. Gonzalez suspected that defendant was responsible for this damage. According to Ms.\\nGonzalez\\u2019s testimony, at approximately noon that day, defendant unexpectedly arrived in his truck,\\nparked the vehicle, exited, approached both her and Gutierrez while brandishing a firearm, and\\ncommenced shooting without uttering any words. In response, Ms. Gonzalez fled to a neighbor\\u2019s\\nresidence but looked back to witness the defendant standing over Gutierrez, continuing to fire.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                               -1-\\n\\fHer neighbor, Amy Velthouse, promptly contacted 911. When first responders arrived, they\\nconfirmed Gutierrez\\u2019s death, noting that he had sustained seven gunshot wounds, including one\\nthat perforated his heart, which would have resulted in nearly immediate fatality.\\n        Upon arrival, police officers encountered Ms. Gonzalez, who identified defendant as the\\nassailant and provided details regarding his vehicle and firearm. This information was\\nsubsequently communicated through central dispatch to Muskegon County, where defendant\\nresides. A deputy from the Muskegon County Sheriff\\u2019s Department later observed defendant\\u2019s\\ntruck traveling south on US 31, conducted a traffic stop, and placed him under arrest. During a\\nsearch of the vehicle, law enforcement discovered a .45 caliber semiautomatic handgun matching\\nthe description given by Ms. Gonzalez. This firearm was registered to defendant.\\n        At the location of the murder, police recovered a series of shell casings on the ground,\\nleading from the driveway to Gutierrez\\u2019s body. This evidence included six spent casings and one\\nlive round of ammunition. Forensic testing confirmed, with a significant degree of certainty, that\\nthe casings were discharged from defendant\\u2019s firearm.\\n\\n       Defendant was subsequently charged with first-degree murder. Following the trial, the jury\\nrendered a verdict of guilty, and the trial court imposed a sentence as previously articulated.\\nDefendant now appeals.\\n                             II. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\\n\\n       On appeal, defendant argues that the evidence of premeditation was legally insufficient to\\nsupport his conviction of first-degree murder.\\n\\n                                   A. STANDARD OF REVIEW\\n\\n        \\u201cIn challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence, this Court reviews the record evidence de\\nnovo in the light most favorable to the prosecution to determine whether a rational trier of fact\\ncould have found that the essential elements of the crime were proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\\u201d\\nPeople v Roper, 286 Mich App 77, 83; 777 NW2d 483 (2009). This standard of review is\\n\\u201c \\u2019deferential,\\u2019 \\u201d and the reviewing court must \\u201c \\u2018draw all reasonable inferences and make\\ncredibility choices in support of the jury verdict.\\u2019 \\u201d People v Oros, 502 Mich 229, 239; 917 NW2d\\n559 (2018), quoting People v Nowack, 462 Mich 392, 400; 614 NW2d 78 (2000). Further, the\\nprosecutor does not have to negate every reasonable theory consistent with innocence\\u2014the\\nprosecutor is bound only \\u201cto prove the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt\\u201d and\\nconvince the jury \\u201cin the face of whatever contradictory evidence the defendant may provide.\\u201d\\nNowack, 462 Mich at 400 (quotation marks and citation omitted). \\u201cCircumstantial evidence and\\nreasonable inferences arising from that evidence can constitute satisfactory proof of the elements\\nof a crime.\\u201d Id. (quotation marks and citation omitted). \\u201cIt is for the trier of fact, not the appellate\\ncourt, to determine what inferences may be fairly drawn from the evidence and to determine the\\nweight to be accorded those inferences.\\u201d Oros, 502 Mich at 239 (quotation marks and citation\\nomitted).\\n\\n                                           B. ANALYSIS\\n\\n       As relevant to the present case, \\u201c[m]urder perpetrated by . . . any . . . willful, deliberate,\\nand premeditated killing\\u201d is first-degree murder. MCL 750.316(1)(a). The elements that the\\nprosecution must prove are \\u201c(1) the intentional killing of a human (2) with premeditation and\\n\\n\\n                                                  -2-\\n\\fdeliberation.\\u201d People v Bennett, 290 Mich App 465, 472; 802 NW2d 627 (2010). In this case,\\ndefendant only challenges the sufficiency of the evidence regarding the element of premeditation.\\nOur Supreme Court has defined the term \\u201cpremeditation,\\u201d which is undefined in the statute, as\\nmeaning \\u201cto think about beforehand.\\u201d Oros, 502 Mich at 240 (quotation marks and citation\\nomitted). The Court further stated:\\n\\n               \\u201cSince the distinguishing elements of first-degree murder ultimately resolve\\n       themselves into questions of fact, minimum standards of proof, if reasonably related\\n       to the circumstances which must be proved, will serve to preserve the distinction\\n       between first-degree and second-degree murder.\\u201d \\u201cThe real focus of first-degree\\n       murder jurisprudence in Michigan has been on the kind of evidence which permits\\n       an inference of premeditation and deliberation,\\u201d and that inference may be\\n       established \\u201cfrom all the facts of the case.\\u201d In other words, when considering a\\n       sufficiency-of-the-evidence issue, \\u201c[t]he question is whether the evidence\\n       introduced at the trial fairly supports an inference of premeditation and\\n       deliberation.\\u201d\\n\\n                                               * * *\\n\\n               Premeditation and deliberation may be established by an interval of time\\n       between the initial homicidal thought and ultimate action, which would allow a\\n       reasonable person time to subject the nature of his or her action to a \\u201csecond look.\\u201d\\n       That is, \\u201csome time span between the initial homicidal intent and ultimate action is\\n       necessary to establish premeditation and deliberation,\\u201d but it is within the province\\n       of the fact-finder to determine whether there was sufficient time for a reasonable\\n       person to subject his or her action to a second look. \\u201cWhile the minimum time\\n       necessary to exercise this process is incapable of exact determination,\\u201d \\u201c[i]t is often\\n       said that premeditation and deliberation require only a \\u2018brief moment of thought\\u2019\\n       or a \\u2018matter of seconds[.]\\u2019 \\u201d \\u201cBy the weight of authority the deliberation essential\\n       to establish murder in the first degree need not have existed for any particular length\\n       of time before the killing.\\u201d \\u201cThe time within which a wicked purpose is formed is\\n       immaterial, provided it is formed without disturbing excitement. The question of\\n       deliberation, when all the circumstances appear, is one of plain common sense; and\\n       an intelligent jury can seldom be at a loss to determine it.\\u201d\\n\\n               \\u201cThe requisite state of mind may be inferred from defendant\\u2019s conduct\\n       judged in light of the circumstances.\\u201d In other words, what constitutes sufficient\\n       evidence to support the elements of premeditation and deliberation may vary from\\n       case to case because the factual circumstances will vary, but the ultimate answer\\n       may be resolved in determining whether reasonable inferences may be made to\\n       support the fact-finder\\u2019s verdict. [Oros, 502 Mich at 241-244 (citations omitted;\\n       first and second alterations in original).]\\n\\n        Premeditation can be inferred from the circumstances surrounding the killing, including\\nthrough \\u201cevidence of (1) the prior relationship of the parties, (2) the defendant\\u2019s actions before the\\nkilling, (3) the circumstances of the killing itself, and (4) the defendant\\u2019s conduct after the\\nhomicide.\\u201d People v Unger, 278 Mich App 210, 229; 749 NW2d 272 (2008).\\n\\n\\n                                                 -3-\\n\\f        Here, the jury heard evidence that defendant sent a text message on the morning of the\\nshooting to Garcia, asking for Gutierrez\\u2019s address. Gutierrez had recently been staying at\\nGonzalez\\u2019s trailer. At about noon that day, defendant found Gutierrez at Gonzalez\\u2019s trailer. When\\ndefendant arrived, he got out of his truck and started shooting without saying anything. Defendant\\nshot Gutierrez seven times, killing him. The handgun that was linked to the shooting was\\nregistered to and found in the possession of defendant.\\n\\n        From this evidence, the jury could reasonably infer that defendant obtained his handgun,\\ngot into his truck, and set out to find and kill Gutierrez. Those inferences support a conclusion\\nthat defendant thought about his actions before carrying them out and had time during his drive\\nsubject his planned actions to a \\u201csecond look.\\u201d Additionally, defendant fired his weapon at the\\nvictim seven times, giving defendant leading to a reasonable conclusion that defendant\\u2019s actions\\nwere deliberate and premeditated. Thus, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the\\nprosecution, a rational trier of fact could have reasonably found beyond a reasonable doubt that\\ndefendant committed the murder with premeditation and deliberation. Roper, 286 Mich App at\\n83; Oros, 502 Mich at 240-244. To the extent defendant appears to argue that the jury should have\\nreached a contrary conclusion and that there was evidence that would have supported a contrary\\nconclusion, we defer to the jury\\u2019s assessments regarding the weight of the evidence and the\\ncredibility of witnesses; it is not our task as an appellate court to redetermine those assessments\\nanew. Oros, 502 Mich at 239.\\n\\n      Accordingly, defendant has not demonstrated that there was insufficient evidence of the\\npremeditation element for first-degree murder, and defendant is not entitled to appellate relief.\\n\\n                       III. INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL\\n\\n       Defendant next argues in his Standard 4 brief that he was denied the effective assistance of\\ncounsel on two grounds and that he is therefore entitled to a new trial.\\n\\n        First, he asserts that Velthouse perjured herself at trial when she testified that she saw\\ndefendant drive away after shooting Gutierrez because this contradicts an Oceana County Sheriff\\u2019s\\nOffice police report in which the officer wrote that Velthouse said that she did not see any vehicles\\nleave. Defendant argues that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to\\ninvestigate Velthouse\\u2019s prior statement and subsequently failing to use the police report to impeach\\nVelthouse during the trial.\\n\\n       Next, defendant argues that defense counsel failed to provide him with a full discovery\\npacket to assist with his own defense. He claims that this failure prevented him from better\\ndeveloping his theory at trial that Gonzalez sought revenge for defendant\\u2019s infidelity, such as\\nthrough presenting Gonzalez\\u2019s text messages to the jury or calling Garcia as a witness.\\n\\n                                  A. STANDARD OF REVIEW\\n\\n        \\u201cWhether a person has been denied effective assistance of counsel is a mixed question of\\nfact and constitutional law.\\u201d People v LeBlanc, 465 Mich 575, 579; 640 NW2d 246 (2002). Any\\nfactual findings are reviewed for clear error, and questions of constitutional law are reviewed de\\nnovo. Id. There has not been an evidentiary hearing on this issue in the present case, and our\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                -4-\\n\\freview is therefore limited to the existing record. People v Snider, 239 Mich App 393, 423; 608\\nNW2d 502 (2000).\\n\\n                     B. STANDARD FOR INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE\\n\\n        A criminal defendant\\u2019s right to the effective assistance of counsel is protected under both\\nthe United States Constitution and the Michigan Constitution. US Const, Am VI; Const 1963, art\\n1, \\u00a7 20. To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must establish that\\n\\u201c(1) the performance of his counsel was below an objective standard of reasonableness under\\nprevailing professional norms and (2) a reasonable probability exists that, in the absence of\\ncounsel\\u2019s unprofessional errors, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different.\\u201d\\nPeople v Sabin (On Second Remand), 242 Mich App 656, 659; 620 NW2d 19 (2000). See also\\nStrickland v Washington, 466 US 668, 687, 688, 694; 104 S Ct 2052; 80 L Ed 2d 674 (1984). \\u201cA\\ndefendant must overcome a strong presumption that the assistance of his counsel was sound trial\\nstrategy, and he must show that, but for counsel\\u2019s error, the outcome of the trial would have been\\ndifferent.\\u201d Sabin (On Second Remand), 242 Mich App at 659.\\n\\n                   C. FAILURE TO USE POLICE REPORT TO IMPEACH\\n\\n        A defense counsel\\u2019s failure to investigate and pursue a substantial defense may support an\\nargument that counsel\\u2019s performance was deficient. People v Chapo, 283 Mich App 360, 371-\\n272; 770 N.W.2d 68 (2009). Additionally, counsel may be ineffective \\u201cif counsel unreasonably\\nfails to develop the defendant\\u2019s defenses by adequately impeaching the witnesses against the\\ndefendant.\\u201d People v Lane, 308 Mich App 38, 68; 862 NW2d 446 (2014). Generally, a witness\\nmay be impeached by any party with a prior inconsistent statement. MRE 607; MRE 613;1 People\\nv Rodriguez, 251 Mich App 10, 34; 650 NW2d 96 (2002). However, defense counsel\\u2019s\\npresumptively strategic trial decisions\\u2014such as questioning witnesses and presenting evidence or\\narguments\\u2014should not be second-guessed on appeal. People v Putman, 309 Mich App 240, 248;\\n870 NW2d 593 (2015).\\n\\n        Here, defendant argues that his trial counsel failed to adequately investigate Velthouse\\u2019s\\nprior statement and failed to impeach Velthouse during the trial with her prior inconsistent\\nstatement regarding whether she saw defendant drive away from the property, but defendant\\u2019s\\ncontentions are not factually supported by the record.\\n\\n         During cross-examination, defense counsel engaged Velthouse regarding her observations\\non the day of the shooting. Counsel raised concerns about a potential inconsistency between her\\ntrial testimony\\u2014where she asserted that she witnessed the defendant driving away\\u2014and the police\\nreport, which indicated that she did not see anyone leave the scene. Furthermore, defense counsel\\ncross-examined Deputy Jeremy Swihart concerning his interview with Velthouse and the report\\nthat highlighted her purportedly inconsistent statements regarding her observations. In closing\\nargument, defense counsel emphasized that Velthouse had modified her account of whether she\\n\\n\\n1\\n  The Michigan Rules of Evidence were substantially amended on September 20, 2023, effective\\nJanuary 1, 2024. See ADM File No. 2021-10, 512 Mich lxiii (2023). We rely on the version of\\nthe rules in effect at the time of trial.\\n\\n\\n                                                -5-\\n\\fsaw the defendant on the day of the incident, arguing that her immediate post-incident statement\\nshould be regarded as more credible than her testimony offered more than a year later. This\\nstrategy clearly illustrated that defense counsel knew of the ambiguity and used it to cast doubt on\\nVelthouse\\u2019s credibility.\\n        The record further reflects that defense counsel conducted a thorough examination of the\\npolice report detailing Velthouse\\u2019s earlier statements. The overarching strategy focused on\\nundermining her credibility in the eyes of the jury. Consequently, defendant has not successfully\\nestablished the factual basis for his claim and is not entitled to any relief. See Lane, 308 Mich\\nApp at 69-70 (rejecting an ineffective assistance of counsel claim because the defendant failed to\\nestablish the factual predicate of his claim).\\n\\n                        D. FAILURE TO PROVIDE FULL DISCOVERY\\n\\n        Defendant asserts on appeal that he asked his trial counsel for the \\u201centire discovery file\\u201d\\nand \\u201crelevant evidence . . . to contest the charges against him,\\u201d but his counsel failed to provide\\nhim with \\u201cExculpatory text messages . . . between Defendant and Crystal Gonzales\\u201d and \\u201crelevant\\npathologist sketch pad reports or key photographs . . . that Defendant believes were missing from\\nthe autopsy exhibits.\\u201d\\n\\n        However, defendant does not cite any evidence on this record showing that he made such\\na request of his trial counsel or that his trial counsel refused to provide defendant with discovery.\\nMoreover, defendant would have been aware of text messages that he sent or received, and\\ndefendant does not further identify what \\u201csketch pad reports or key photographs\\u201d were missing.\\nTherefore, defendant cannot show that but for trial counsel\\u2019s alleged deficient performance, there\\nis any reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different. Sabin (On\\nSecond Remand), 242 Mich App at 659.\\n\\n         Defendant further contends that counsel was ineffective for failing to call Garcia as a\\nwitness to verify that Gonzalez was seeking revenge against defendant. \\u201cTrial counsel\\u2019s failure to\\na call a witness is only considered ineffective assistance if it deprived the defendant of a substantial\\ndefense. A substantial defense is one that could have affected the outcome of the trial.\\u201d Putman,\\n309 Mich App at 248 (citation omitted). Here, defendant\\u2019s trial counsel elicited testimony from\\nGonzalez on cross-examination that Gonzalez had specifically started seeing Gutierrez as a form\\nof revenge against defendant and that Gonzalez had made social-media posts expressing her anger\\nat defendant and her desire to get \\u201cpayback.\\u201d Therefore, the decision to refrain from calling Garcia\\ndid not deprive defendant of a substantial defense.\\n\\n        Moreover, \\u201c[d]ecisions regarding whether to call or question a witness are presumed to be\\nmatters of trial strategy,\\u201d and \\u201c[t]his Court will not second-guess counsel on matters of trial\\nstrategy, nor will it assess counsel\\u2019s competence with the benefit of hindsight.\\u201d Putman, 309 Mich\\nApp at 248 (quotation marks and citation omitted). Defendant has not presented any evidence to\\novercome the heavy burden of showing that his trial counsel\\u2019s reasons for presenting this defense\\nwithout including Garcia\\u2019s testimony constituted a sound strategy. Sabin (On Second Remand),\\n242 Mich App at 659. Defendant also has not demonstrated that he was denied the effective\\nassistance of counsel based on the alleged failures regarding discovery and the presentation of\\nwitnesses.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                  -6-\\n\\f                             IV. EVIDENTIARY RULING AT TRIAL\\n\\n\\n\\n         Defendant argues in his Standard 4 brief that he is entitled to a new trial because the trial\\ncourt erroneously admitted into evidence a photograph of Gutierrez\\u2019s damaged car. Gonzalez\\ntestified that she and Gutierrez were setting up security cameras on the morning of the shooting\\nbecause someone had \\u201cgotten into\\u201d their \\u201cstuff\\u201d the previous night and damaged Gutierrez\\u2019s car.\\nGonzalez further testified that she thought defendant was responsible for those acts, but she did\\nnot have any evidence to support that theory. On appeal, defendant argues that the photograph\\nshould have been excluded from evidence because the photograph was not relevant and its\\nprobative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\\n\\n                                   A. STANDARD OF REVIEW\\n\\n        Defendant\\u2019s trial counsel objected to the admission of the photograph based on relevance,\\nand the trial court ruled that the photograph was relevant and admissible. Therefore, defendant\\u2019s\\nappellate argument is preserved to the extent he argues that the photograph was not relevant.\\nPeople v Metamora Water Serv, Inc, 276 Mich App 376, 383; 741 NW2d 61 (2007) (stating that\\n\\u201can issue is preserved for appellate review when the issued was raised, addressed, and decided by\\nthe lower court\\u201d). However, defendant did not object on the ground that admission of the\\nphotograph would violate MRE 403. \\u201cAn objection based on one ground at trial is insufficient to\\npreserve an appellate attack based on a different ground.\\u201d People v Stimage, 202 Mich App 28,\\n30; 507 NW2d 778 (1993). Thus, defendant\\u2019s appellate argument that the photograph was\\ninadmissible pursuant to MRE 403 is unpreserved. Id.\\n\\n        We review preserved arguments regarding the admissibility of evidence for an abuse of\\ndiscretion. Unger, 278 Mich App at 216. \\u201cAn abuse of discretion occurs when the court chooses\\nan outcome that falls outside the range of reasonable and principled outcomes.\\u201d Id. at 217.\\nPreliminary questions of law, \\u201csuch as whether a rule of evidence precludes admissibility,\\u201d are\\nreviewed de novo. People v Chelmicki, 305 Mich App 58, 62; 850 NW2d 612 (2014).\\n\\n         However, \\u201c[n]o judgment or verdict shall be set aside or reversed or a new trial be granted\\nby any court of this state in any criminal case, on the ground of . . . the improper admission or\\nrejection of evidence . . . unless in the opinion of the court, after an examination of the entire cause,\\nit shall affirmatively appear that the error complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.\\u201d\\nMCL 769.26. Pursuant to MCL 769.26, it is the defendant\\u2019s burden to demonstrate that a\\npreserved, nonconstitutional error more probably than not resulted in a miscarriage of justice in\\norder to justify reversal of a conviction. People v Lukity, 460 Mich 484, 495; 596 NW2d 607\\n(1999). As the Lukity Court explained:\\n\\n        [R]eversal is only required if such an error is prejudicial and that the appropriate\\n        inquiry \\u201cfocuses on the nature of the error and assesses its effect in light of the\\n        weight and strength of the untainted evidence.\\u201d The object of this inquiry is to\\n        determine if it affirmatively appears that the error asserted \\u201cundermine[s] the\\n        reliability of the verdict.\\u201d In other words, the effect of the error is evaluated by\\n        assessing it in the context of the untainted evidence to determine whether it is more\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                  -7-\\n\\f       probable than not that a different outcome would have resulted without the error.\\n       Therefore, the bottom line is that \\u00a7 26 presumes that a preserved, nonconstitutional\\n       error is not a ground for reversal unless \\u201cafter an examination of the entire cause, it\\n       shall affirmatively appear\\u201d that it is more probable than not that the error was\\n       outcome determinative. [Id. at 495-496 (citations omitted; second alteration in\\n       original).]\\n\\n        We review unpreserved claims of evidentiary error for plain error affecting substantial\\nrights. Id. \\u201cTo avoid forfeiture under the plain error rule, three requirements must be met: 1) error\\nmust have occurred, 2) the error was plain, i.e., clear or obvious, 3) and the plain error affected\\nsubstantial rights.\\u201d People v Carines, 460 Mich 750, 763; 597 NW2d 130 (1999). It is defendant\\u2019s\\nburden to demonstrate prejudice by showing that \\u201cthe error affected the outcome of the lower court\\nproceedings.\\u201d Id. Even if these three requirements are satisfied, reversal \\u201cis warranted only when\\nthe plain, forfeited error resulted in the conviction of an actually innocent defendant or when an\\nerror seriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings\\nindependent of the defendant\\u2019s innocence.\\u201d Id. at 763-764 (quotation marks and citation omitted;\\nalteration in original).\\n\\n                                          B. ANALYSIS\\n\\n        In general terms, all relevant evidence is admissible unless otherwise provided by the rules\\nof evidence, Supreme Court rule, or the federal or state constitution, and evidence that is not\\nrelevant is not admissible. MRE 402.2 \\u201cRelevant evidence\\u201d means \\u201cevidence having any tendency\\nto make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more\\nprobable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\\u201d MRE 401. However, relevant\\nevidence \\u201cmay be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of\\nunfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue\\ndelay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\\u201d MRE 403. \\u201cEvidence is\\nunfairly prejudicial when there exists a danger that marginally probative evidence will be given\\nundue or preemptive weight by the jury.\\u201d People v Crawford, 458 Mich 376, 398; 582 NW2d 785\\n(1998).\\n\\n        Here, even assuming without deciding that defendant is correct in his assertion that the\\nphotograph was not relevant and therefore not admissible, defendant has not demonstrated that it\\nis more probable than not, considering the untainted evidence, that a different outcome would have\\nresulted if the photograph had not been admitted. Gonzalez testified that she saw defendant get\\nout his truck and start shooting at her and Gutierrez and that she saw defendant standing over\\nGutierrez\\u2019s body while continuing to shoot him. Given the strength of this evidence that defendant\\ncommitted the murder, evidence related to the tangential question whether Gutierrez\\u2019s car was\\ndamaged the night before likely had little influence on the jury\\u2019s verdict. Considering the weight\\nand strength of the untainted evidence, it is not more probable than not that the jury would not\\nhave convicted defendant of first-degree murder had the photograph not been admitted at trial.\\nThus, any error in the admission of this photograph was harmless and does not require reversal.\\n\\n\\n2\\n  As previously stated, we will rely on the Rules of Evidence as they existed at the time of\\ndefendant\\u2019s trial.\\n\\n\\n                                                -8-\\n\\fLukity, 460 Mich at 495-496. For the same reasons, defendant cannot demonstrate the requisite\\nprejudice from any plain error\\u2014assuming without deciding that one occurred\\u2014in admitting the\\nphotograph contrary to MRE 403.

J. KELLY, P.J., and BORRELLO and RICK, JJ.\\n\\nPER CURIAM.\\n\\n         Carlos Andres Sanchez, hereinafter defendant, appeals as of right his convictions by jury\\nof first-degree murder, MCL 750.316(1)(a), and possession of a firearm during the commission of\\na felony (felony-firearm), MCL 750.227b(1). The trial court sentenced defendant to life in prison\\nwithout parole for his murder conviction and a two-year consecutive sentence for his felony\\nfirearm conviction. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm.\\n\\n                                      I. BACKGROUND\\n\\n       This case arises from the murder of Miguel Gutierrez at the residence of Crystal Gonzalez.\\nMs. Gonzalez provided testimony indicating that she had an intermittent relationship with\\ndefendant. Subsequently, she discovered the defendant with another individual, Marissa Garcia,\\nwhich prompted her to engage in a relationship with Gutierrez, who was, notably, Garcia\\u2019s ex-\\nboyfriend in order to \\u201cretaliate\\u201d against defendant.\\n\\n       On the day of the murder, Ms. Gonzalez was present at her trailer in Montague, Michigan,\\nwith Gutierrez, who had been residing there. They were in the process of installing security\\ncameras on the property due to an incident that had damaged Gutierrez\\u2019s vehicle the previous day.\\nMs. Gonzalez suspected that defendant was responsible for this damage. According to Ms.\\nGonzalez\\u2019s testimony, at approximately noon that day, defendant unexpectedly arrived in his truck,\\nparked the vehicle, exited, approached both her and Gutierrez while brandishing a firearm, and\\ncommenced shooting without uttering any words. In response, Ms. Gonzalez fled to a neighbor\\u2019s\\nresidence but looked back to witness the defendant standing over Gutierrez, continuing to fire.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                               -1-\\n\\fHer neighbor, Amy Velthouse, promptly contacted 911. When first responders arrived, they\\nconfirmed Gutierrez\\u2019s death, noting that he had sustained seven gunshot wounds, including one\\nthat perforated his heart, which would have resulted in nearly immediate fatality.\\n        Upon arrival, police officers encountered Ms. Gonzalez, who identified defendant as the\\nassailant and provided details regarding his vehicle and firearm. This information was\\nsubsequently communicated through central dispatch to Muskegon County, where defendant\\nresides. A deputy from the Muskegon County Sheriff\\u2019s Department later observed defendant\\u2019s\\ntruck traveling south on US 31, conducted a traffic stop, and placed him under arrest. During a\\nsearch of the vehicle, law enforcement discovered a .45 caliber semiautomatic handgun matching\\nthe description given by Ms. Gonzalez. This firearm was registered to defendant.\\n        At the location of the murder, police recovered a series of shell casings on the ground,\\nleading from the driveway to Gutierrez\\u2019s body. This evidence included six spent casings and one\\nlive round of ammunition. Forensic testing confirmed, with a significant degree of certainty, that\\nthe casings were discharged from defendant\\u2019s firearm.\\n\\n       Defendant was subsequently charged with first-degree murder. Following the trial, the jury\\nrendered a verdict of guilty, and the trial court imposed a sentence as previously articulated.\\nDefendant now appeals.\\n                             II. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\\n\\n       On appeal, defendant argues that the evidence of premeditation was legally insufficient to\\nsupport his conviction of first-degree murder.\\n\\n                                   A.

The motion to\\ndismiss was premised upon the argument that the criminalization of the mere possession of\\nmetallic knuckles violates the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, as well as\\nthat amendment\\u2019s counterpart in our state constitution, Const 1963, art 1, \\u00a7 6.

BACKGROUND\\n\\n       As noted, defendant was charged with (among other things) a violation of MCL\\n750.224(1)(d), for possessing metallic knuckles. Defendant moved the trial court to dismiss that\\ncharge, arguing that facially, and as applied to him, that statutory prohibition violates both the\\nSecond Amendment to the United States Constitution, US Const, Am II, and Article 1, \\u00a7 6 of the\\nMichigan Constitution, Const 1963, art 1, \\u00a7 6, and their protection of an individual\\u2019s right to keep\\nand bear arms.\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n People v Dummer, unpublished order of the Court of Appeals, entered July 17, 2024 (Docket\\nNo. 369752).\\n\\n\\n                                                -1-\\n\\f         The trial court denied defendant\\u2019s motion, concluding that his argument failed because: (1)\\ndefendant was not challenging the entirety of MCL 750.224, and therefore could not be successful\\nin his facial challenge; (2) metallic knuckles had regularly been viewed as used by criminals or for\\nimproper purposes and were \\u201cdangerous and unusual\\u201d; and (3) metallic knuckles were not\\nprimarily a self-defense weapon. With these conclusions, the court held that defendant had not\\nmet his burden to establish the constitutional invalidity of the statute.\\n\\n           II. STANDARD OF REVIEW AND CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES\\n\\n        \\u201cMatters of constitutional and statutory interpretation are reviewed de novo.\\u201d People v\\nSkinner, 502 Mich 89, 99; 917 NW2d 292 (2018). The \\u201cauthority to invalidate laws is limited and\\nmust be predicated on a clearly apparent demonstration of unconstitutionality.\\u201d People v Harris,\\n495 Mich 120, 134; 845 NW2d 477 (2014). \\u201cStatutes are presumed to be constitutional, and we\\nhave a duty to construe a statute as constitutional unless its unconstitutionality is clearly apparent.\\u201d\\nIn re Sanders, 495 Mich 394, 404; 852 NW2d 524 (2014). \\u201cA statute challenged on a\\nconstitutional basis is clothed in a presumption of constitutionality, and the burden of proving that\\na statute is unconstitutional rests with the party challenging it.\\u201d In re Request for Advisory Opinion\\nRegarding Constitutionality of 2005 PA 71, 479 Mich 1, 11; 740 NW2d 444 (2007) (quotation\\nmarks and citation omitted).\\n\\n         \\u201cA challenge to the constitutionality of a statute is either a facial challenge or an as-applied\\nchallenge.\\u201d Promote the Vote v Secretary of State, 333 Mich App 93, 117; 958 NW2d 861 (2020).\\nOn appeal, defendant only presses his facial challenge to MCL 750.224(1)(d).2 \\u201cA facial challenge\\nis a claim that the law is invalid in toto\\u2014and therefore incapable of any valid application, whereas\\nan as-applied challenge considers the specific application of a facially valid law to individual\\nfacts.\\u201d Promote the Vote, 333 Mich App at 117 (quotation marks and citation omitted). As this\\nCourt has summarized:\\n\\n                A party challenging the facial constitutionality of a statute faces an\\n        extremely rigorous standard. A plaintiff must establish that no set of circumstances\\n        exists under which the act would be valid, and the fact that the act might operate\\n        unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances is insufficient to\\n        render the act invalid. Indeed, if any state of facts reasonably can be conceived that\\n        would sustain a legislative act, the existence of the state of facts at the time the law\\n        was enacted must be assumed. Because facial attacks, by their nature, are not\\n        dependent on the facts surrounding any particular decision, the specific facts\\n        surrounding plaintiffs\\u2019 claim are inapposite. [Id. at 117-118 (quotation marks and\\n        citations omitted; alterations omitted).]\\n\\n\\nAs to the difficulty in successfully pursuing a facial challenge to the constitutionality of a statute,\\nthe same holds true under federal law. See, e.g., United States v Salerno, 481 US 739, 745; 107 S\\n\\n\\n2\\n  Defendant asks that if his facial challenge fails we consider his as-applied argument. But his\\nrequest is not an adequately developed one, so is not sufficiently preserved for appellate\\nconsideration. See In re Rippy, 330 Mich App 350, 362 n 5; 948 NW2d 131 (2019).\\n\\n\\n                                                  -2-\\n\\fCt 2095; 95 L Ed 2d 697 (1987) (\\u201cA facial challenge to a legislative Act is, of course, the most\\ndifficult challenge to mount successfully, since the challenger must establish that no set of\\ncircumstances exists under which the Act would be valid.\\u201d).\\n\\n        There is no requirement that a facial challenge to a statute be levied against the entirety of\\na statute, as opposed to a challenge limited to the specific offending statutory provision. In fact,\\nthe opposite is true, as the Legislature has indicated that:\\n\\n       If any portion of an act or the application thereof to any person or circumstances\\n       shall be found to be invalid by a court, such invalidity shall not affect the remaining\\n       portions or applications of the act which can be given effect without the invalid\\n       portion or application, provided such remaining portions are not determined by the\\n       court to be inoperable, and to this end acts are declared to be severable.

SECOND AMENDMENT JURISPRUDENCE\\n\\n        The purpose of the first ten amendments to the federal Constitution, known as the Bill of\\nRights, was to protect the rights enumerated in those amendments from interference by the federal\\ngovernment. See McDonald v Chicago, 561 US 742, 754; 130 S Ct 3020; 177 L Ed 2d 894 (2010)\\n(\\u201cThe Bill of Rights, including the Second Amendment, originally applied only to the Federal\\nGovernment.\\u201d); Lessee of Livingston v Moore, 32 US 469, 551-552; 8 L Ed 751 (1833) (\\u201c[I]t is\\nnow settled, that those amendments [in the Bill of Rights] do not extend to the states[.]\\u201d). The\\nFounders were less concerned that States would interfere with their residents\\u2019 rights, given the\\ncloser connection between a state government and its constituents. See Nat\\u2019l Federation of\\nIndependent Business v Sebelius, 567 US 519, 575-588; 132 S Ct 2566; 183 L Ed 2d 450 (2012)\\n(opinion by ROBERTS, J.) (\\u201cBecause the police power is controlled by 50 different States instead\\nof one national sovereign, the facets of governing that touch on citizens\\u2019 daily lives are normally\\nadministered by smaller governments closer to the governed.

According to the Court in McDonald, 561 US at\\n767, the Second Amendment resulted from the Founders\\u2019 belief that \\u201c[s]elf-defense is a basic right,\\nrecognized by many legal systems from ancient times to the present day, and [as a result] in\\n[District of Columbia v] Heller [, 554 US 570, 599; 128 S Ct 2783; 171 L Ed 2d 637 (2008)], we\\nheld that individual self-defense is the central component of the Second Amendment right.\\u201d\\n(quotation marks and citations omitted).\\n\\n        Because both \\u201cprovisions grant individuals a right to keep and bear arms for self-defense,\\u201d\\nPeople v Yanna, 297 Mich App 137, 142; 824 NW2d 241 (2012), Second Amendment4 challenges\\ntypically revolve around two questions: (1) is the conduct at issue covered by the amendment, and\\nif so, (2) can the state regulate the conduct consistent with the amendment?5 To answer these\\nquestions, we turn to the two-part test articulated in New York State Rifle & Pistol Ass\\u2019n, Inc v\\nBruen, 597 US 1, 17, 24; 142 S Ct 2111; 213 L Ed 2d 387 (2022), which is employed when\\naddressing challenges to government regulation of arms as violative of the Second Amendment.\\nUnder Bruen, courts must first determine whether the plain language of the Second Amendment\\nprotects the conduct which the government regulation prohibits. Here, that conduct is possession\\nof metallic knuckles. If the amendment does protect the challenged conduct, it is then the\\ngovernment\\u2019s burden to establish that the particular regulation of that protected conduct is\\nnonetheless permissible pursuant to our national historical tradition of weapon regulation. The\\nBruen Court summarized this analytical framework:\\n\\n       [W]e hold that when the Second Amendment\\u2019s plain text covers an individual\\u2019s\\n       conduct, the Constitution presumptively protects that conduct. To justify its\\n       regulation, the government may not simply posit that the regulation promotes an\\n       important interest. Rather, the government must demonstrate that the regulation is\\n       consistent with this Nation\\u2019s historical tradition of firearm regulation. Only if a\\n       firearm regulation is consistent with this Nation\\u2019s historical tradition may a court\\n       conclude that the individual\\u2019s conduct falls outside the Second Amendment\\u2019s\\n       unqualified command.

See Heller, 554 US at 580-581; Wade, 347\\nMich App at 614. The parties do, however, address whether possession of metallic knuckles is\\nprotected by the plain text of the amendment, and they seem to agree that metallic knuckles are a\\nweapon and, therefore, constitute an \\u201carm\\u201d under the amendment. Their conclusion is correct, for\\naccording to Heller an \\u201carm\\u201d is any weapon used for offense or self-defense:\\n\\n       The 1773 edition of Samuel Johnson\\u2019s dictionary defined \\u201carms\\u201d as \\u201c[w]eapons of\\n       offence, or armour of defence.\\u201d 1 Dictionary of the English Language 106 (4th ed.)\\n       (reprinted 1978) (hereinafter Johnson). Timothy Cunningham\\u2019s important 1771\\n       legal dictionary defined \\u201carms\\u201d as \\u201cany thing that a man wears for his defence, or\\n       takes into his hands, or useth in wrath to cast at or strike another.\\u201d 1 A New and\\n       Complete Law Dictionary; see also N.

[Heller,\\n       554 US at 581 (alteration in original)].\\n\\nAdditionally, the \\u201cdefinition of \\u2018bear\\u2019 naturally encompasses public carry,\\u201d or, more simply put,\\npossession. Bruen, 597 US at 32 (stating that Heller confirmed that the right to \\u201cbear arms\\u201d refers\\nto the right to \\u201cwear, bear, or carry . . . upon the person or in the clothing or in a pocket, for the\\npurpose . . . of being armed and ready for offensive or defensive action in a case of conflict with\\nanother person\\u201d). Because metallic knuckles can be used to either attack or thwart off an attacker,\\nor stated differently, can be taken into an individual\\u2019s hand to strike another, pursuant to Heller,\\nthe plain language of the Second Amendment applies to defendant\\u2019s possession (\\u201cbearing\\u201d) of\\nmetallic knuckles (\\u201carms\\u201d).\\n\\n        So far so good for defendant\\u2019s position. But as Heller, Bruen, and subsequent courts have\\nnoted, protected \\u201carms\\u201d include only those weapons commonly used and possessed by law-abiding\\ncitizens for lawful purposes. See Rocky Mountain Gun Owners, 121 F4th at 116-117, and Yanna,\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                 -6-\\n\\f279 Mich App at 143 (recognizing that the Second Amendment does not protect weapons not\\ntypically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes).\\n\\n        But where do we address this \\u201ccommon use\\u201d consideration\\u2014during Bruen\\u2019s first or second\\nstep? Where courts consider the common use issue is more than a theoretical matter, as which\\nparty bears the burden of proof differs at each step: defendant has the initial burden under step one\\nto establish that the challenged act is covered by the amendment, and if he does so, the prosecution\\nhas the burden to prove that regulation of metallic knuckles has historically occurred in a similar,\\nthough not identical, manner as it is in the challenged statute. See Bruen, 597 US at 17.\\n\\n       \\u201cThere is no consensus on whether the common-use issue belongs under Bruen step one or\\nBruen step two.\\u201d Bevis v City of Naperville, 85 F4th 1175, 1198 (CA 7, 2024); see also\\nCommonwealth v Canjura, 494 Mass 508, 515 n 10; 240 NE3d 213 (2024), citing Bevis, 85 F4th\\nat 1198; Hanson v District of Columbia, ___ US App DC ___;120 F4th 223, 232 n 3 (2024)\\n(assuming, without deciding, that the \\u201ccommon use\\u201d test applied under the first step); United States\\nv Price, 111 F4th 392, 415 (CA 4, 2024) (QUATTLEBAUM and RUSHING, JJ., concurring) (\\u201c[T]he\\nmajority analyzes common use at Bruen\\u2019s plain text step, while Judge Richardson in dissent and\\nJudge Niemeyer in concurrence reason that common use falls under Bruen\\u2019s historical tradition\\nstep.

See, e.g., Heller, 554 US\\nat 625 (\\u201c[T]he Second Amendment does not protect those weapons not typically possessed by law-\\nabiding citizens for lawful purposes, such as short-barreled shotguns.\\u201d); Price, 111 F4th at 400-\\n401 (\\u201cThe Court in Bruen focused on the third of these inquiries, and for good reason\\u2014there was\\nno dispute in that case that the petitioners, \\u2018two ordinary, law-abiding, adult citizens,\\u2019 were among\\nthe people protected by the Second Amendment, and neither party disputed that the weapons\\nregulated by the challenged regulation\\u2014handguns\\u2014were in common use for self-defense. But by\\nengaging in these inquiries at step one, Bruen made clear that the limitations on the scope of the\\nSecond Amendment right identified in Heller are inherent in the text of the amendment.\\u201d) (citation\\nomitted); United States v Lane, 689 F Supp 3d 232, 252 n 22 (ED Va, 2023); United States v\\nBerger, 715 F Supp 3d 676, 681-686 (ED Pa, 2024) (\\u201cFollowing Bruen, most federal courts\\nconsidering Second Amendment challenges address the common-use issue at step one of the\\nanalysis.\\u201d); State v Giannone, 228 Conn App 11, 46-60; 323 A3d 360 (2024) (\\u201cConsequently, the\\ncommon use analysis informs whether the conduct at issue is covered by the second amendment\\u2019s\\nplain text and asks whether an instrument, even if it is an \\u2018arm,\\u2019 is the type of arm that is protected\\nby the second amendment\\u2014that is, as Bruen and Heller instruct, an arm that is commonly used or\\ntypically possessed for lawful purposes like self-defense\\u2014or is instead a dangerous and unusual\\nweapon that falls outside of the second amendment\\u2019s scope.\\u201d).\\n\\n       But unlike some courts, we do not see the \\u201ccommon use\\u201d consideration as encompassing\\nwhether the arm is also, or conversely, a \\u201cdangerous and unusual\\u201d weapon that is not protected by\\nthe amendment. See Canjura, 494 Mass at 516 (recognizing that there is a split on whether the\\ncommon-use and dangerous and unusual considerations are distinct).

If the answer is yes, the Second Amendment presumptively\\n       applies. However, certain specific types of such weapons may still be subject to\\n       regulation if they are \\u201cdangerous and unusual,\\u201d consistent with text, history, and\\n       tradition. Put another way, the first step (that is, what is presumptively protected\\n       by the Second Amendment) addresses broad categories, and the second step (that\\n       is, what may be regulated) applies to specific types of weapons (or, in appropriate\\n       cases, specific persons who cannot possess weapons or specific places where\\n       weapons cannot be carried).\\n\\nIn our view this latter test is more focused on the historical treatment of a weapon, shown by how\\nit was treated during the relevant time, and whether it is one of those weapons that has been part\\nof the \\u201chistorical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons\\u201d subject\\nto regulation.

See also Berger, 715 F Supp 3d at 691 (recognizing\\nthat some courts have looked to the number of state laws regulating the weapon).\\n\\n         On this last point defendant has submitted statistical information from a website regarding\\nhow many states currently preclude the possession of metallic knuckles, how many regulate but\\ndo not ban their possession, and how many states leave them unregulated. Accepting those\\nrepresentations as true (the prosecution has not disputed their accuracy), there are currently 21\\nother states with statutory prohibitions on possession of metallic knuckles identical (or very\\nsimilar) to Michigan\\u2019s, while another 17 have myriad regulations on the possession and use of\\nmetallic knuckles. The remaining 12 states do not regulate metallic knuckles. These numbers,\\nagain accepting their accuracy, show that just shy of a majority of states currently regulate the\\npossession of these weapons, and a small minority have no regulation. While these numbers do\\nnot tell us much about how commonly they are used in today\\u2019s America,8 we will err on the side\\nof caution, Heller, 554 US at 582, 595 (Second Amendment applies prima facie to all bearable\\nweapons), and infer that because a small minority of states do not regulate the possession and use\\nof metallic knuckles, they are commonly used for lawful purposes. See, e.g., Canjura, 494 Mass\\nat 516 (where only 7 states ban switchblades, court inferred that they were commonly used today\\nfor self-defense).\\n\\n        For these reasons, we hold that defendant\\u2019s conduct of bearing metallic knuckles was an\\nactivity covered by the plain text of the Second Amendment, and therefore is presumptively\\nconstitutionally protected conduct.\\n\\n      B.

In that regard, defendant argues that the\\nprosecution failed to meet its burden to establish that there has been a historic tradition in the\\nUnited States of regulating or prohibiting the possession of metallic knuckles. In addressing this\\nhistorical question, we look to the extent the states prohibited possession of these weapons during\\nthe relevant time period.\\n\\n       Once it is established that the plain language of the Second Amendment covers an\\nindividual\\u2019s otherwise prohibited conduct, as is the case here, the burden then shifts to the\\ngovernment to establish that such a prohibition is rooted in historical tradition to the extent that it\\n\\n\\n8\\n  See Friedman v City of Highland Park, Ill, 784 F3d 406, 409 (CA 7, 2015), and Avitabile v\\nBeach, 368 F Supp 3d 404, 411 (ND NY, 2019) (both expressing uncertainty about relying on how\\ncommon a weapon is today when the challenged statute prohibits their use).\\n\\n\\n                                                 -9-\\n\\fis constitutionally permissible.

The Court explained\\nhow this analysis would proceed:\\n\\n       For example, if laws at the founding regulated firearm use to address particular\\n       problems, that will be a strong indicator that contemporary laws imposing similar\\n       restrictions for similar reasons fall within a permissible category of regulations.\\n       Even when a law regulates arms-bearing for a permissible reason, though, it may\\n       not be compatible with the right if it does so to an extent beyond what was done at\\n       the founding. And when a challenged regulation does not precisely match its\\n       historical precursors, it still may be analogous enough to pass constitutional muster.\\n       The law must comport with the principles underlying the Second Amendment, but\\n       it need not be a \\u201cdead ringer\\u201d or a \\u201chistorical twin.\\u201d [Id.

Bruen, 597 US at 38.\\n\\n        In support of its burden to establish a showing that a ban on possessing metallic knuckles\\nis historically permissible, the prosecution cited the following: court precedent dating from 1871\\nuntil 1921 from four states; five state statutes prohibiting metallic knuckles with enactment dates\\nranging between 1872 and 2007, only one of which strictly prohibits the possession of metallic\\nknuckles; and one law review article from 1983.9 However, it has provided no evidence of how\\nmetallic knuckles were treated from 1791 until 1868.10\\n\\n        Digging a little deeper11 into how metallic knuckles were historically treated, we can\\ndiscern that from approximately 1845 and onward metallic knuckles were associated not with law-\\n\\n\\n9\\n  The prosecution\\u2019s citation to People v Williams, 106 NYS3d 738 (2019), was misplaced, as that\\ncourt analyzed the legality of banning trench knives\\u2014metallic knuckles with a knife attached to\\nit\\u2014as strictly a type of knife; the court did not evaluate whether a ban on metallic knuckles was\\nreconcilable with the Second Amendment.\\n10\\n   The Bruen majority noted that a court\\u2019s review of these issues generally should be \\u201cbased on\\nthe historical record compiled by the parties.\\u201d Bruen, 597 US at 25 n 6. But relying solely on\\nparty presentation to resolve a dispute about constitutional history potentially opens the door to\\nreaching a conclusion based on an incomplete or inaccurate picture of the relevant statistics. See\\nWorth v Harrington, 666 F Supp 3d 902, 917 (D Minn, 2023).\\n11\\n  The number of decisions addressing weapons prohibitions under the Second Amendment is not\\nas high as one might think, as the Amendment was only incorporated against the States through\\nthe Fourteenth Amendment in 2010.

Apparently, too many years had passed since the\\nnation's founding. Along the way, the meaning of the Constitution had become muddled. The\\nWorkman case provides a reason to suspect that other state legislatures during the late 1800s may\\nhave likewise incorrectly regarded a billy as beyond the ambit of the Second Amendment.\\nWorkman is exactly the reason Bruen looks to Founding-era laws, not post-Civil War laws, to\\nunderstand the Bill of Rights.\\u201d).\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                -12-\\n\\f       The blackjack is properly included in the list of outlawed weapons.

These\\nregulations entailed anything from total bans to limits on concealed carry,13 but importantly for\\nour purposes, these state statutes reveal that these mid-to-late nineteenth century policymakers\\ntreated metallic knuckles as weapons that were unusual and dangerous, not used for self-defense\\nof any kind, and typically only found in the hands of thugs and murderers. See, e.g., Bell v State,\\n89 Ala 61, 61-62; 8 So 133 (1890) (in a case where the defendant was being prosecuted for carrying\\nconcealed brass knuckles in violation of an 1886 statute, the court noted that \\u201c[t]he carrying\\nconcealed of a barbarous weapon of this class, which is usually the instrument of an assassin, and\\nan index of a murderous heart, is absolutely prohibited by section 3776 of the Criminal Code of\\nthis state.

[State v Kerner, 181 NC 574; 107 SE\\n       222, 224 (1921)].\\n\\n         We have not been pointed to, nor have we found, any statutes or caselaw that consider\\nmetallic knuckles as anything other than dangerous and unusual, and as a weapon not possessed\\nby law abiding citizens for lawful purposes. Although this historical law is from the outer end of\\nthe relevant time period, it supports our conclusion that metallic knuckles were considered unusual\\nand dangerous, and were deemed to be mainly used by those engaging in criminal acts. And as a\\nresult, these weapons were either extensively regulated, or banned.\\n\\n        Though there is no precise definition of what constitutes a dangerous and unusual weapon,\\nat one end the Supreme Court has held that handguns are \\u201cthe quintessential self-defense weapon\\u201d\\nand are \\u201cindisputably\\u201d not dangerous and unusual, Bruen, 597 US at 47 (quotation marks and\\ncitation omitted), while at the other end it has identified \\u201cM-16 rifles and the like\\u201d as examples of\\ndangerous and unusual weapons that \\u201cmay be banned,\\u201d Heller, 554 US at 627. And certainly,\\nbecause hand guns are dangerous, that factor alone cannot suffice to make an arm subject to lawful\\nregulation.14\\n\\n       Nevertheless, we conclude that these statutory regulations reflect what the courts noted\\nabove have uniformly concluded\\u2014that policymakers before and soon after the ratification of the\\nFourteenth Amendment considered metallic knuckles to be dangerous and unusual weapons that\\nwere not used by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes, and therefore were subject to regulation.\\nBut as we detail below, the regulations entailed many different restrictions, with the majority being\\nprohibitions of concealed carry.\\n\\n        The mid-to-late nineteenth century saw at least 14 states and the District of Columbia\\nenacting bans on concealed carry of metallic knuckles.

During this same period, five states\\nalso banned sales of metallic knuckles.

First, they confirm that from approximately 1845 until the\\n1890s states enacted numerous prohibitions of varying types on metallic knuckles. As recounted\\nabove, most focused on precluding concealed carry, while others focused on sale bans or simple\\npossession. But in all, during this pre-and-post Civil War time period, almost 25 jurisdictions had\\nsome type of restriction on the possession or sale of metallic knuckles.

But at the same time, as in Bruen, \\u201c[a]lthough the historical\\nrecord yields relatively few 18th- and 19th-century [laws] where weapons [metallic knuckles] were\\naltogether prohibited . . . we are also aware of no disputes regarding the lawfulness of such\\nprohibitions\\u201d and \\u201c[w]e therefore can assume it settled that these . . . arms . . . could be prohibited\\nconsistent with the Second Amendment.\\u201d Id. at 30.\\n\\n       In other words, unless the absence of any known regulation on the possession of metallic\\nknuckles in 1791 or in the recent years thereafter forecloses a conclusion that any subsequent ban\\nis unconstitutional, a consistent Reconstruction Era history of regulating metallic knuckles\\n\\n\\n                                                 -15-\\n\\fprovides a sufficient historic basis to reach our decision today, as those laws provide an over-\\narching principle from the time at which the Second Amendment was (theoretically) made\\napplicable to the States.

And,\\nimportantly, none of these mid-to-late nineteenth century laws contradict any laws from 1791.

This can be seen in the laws and cases cited by Heller itself. In recounting that regulation\\nof dangerous and unusual weapons has occurred since our nation\\u2019s founding (and therefore\\nconsistent with the Second Amendment), the Heller Court cited to numerous legal sources\\nrecognizing the commonality of these regulations in both England and during the formative years\\nof this country.

As at least one court recognized, \\u201c[t]he fact that Founding-era laws singled\\nout dangerous and unusual weapons for differential treatment without banning the weapons is,\\ntherefore, non-dispositive. Rather, that tradition developed, such that by the Reconstruction-era,\\nthe tradition encompassed possession bans.\\u201d Rupp v Bonta, 723 F Supp 3d 837, 878 (CD Cal,\\n2024). See also Price, 111 F4th at 431-432 (RICHARDSON, J., dissenting) (\\u201cThe relevant\\nnineteenth-century cases that undergird the dangerous-and-unusual tradition also addressed\\nstatutes that prohibited the possession or carry of classes of weapons defined by functional\\u2014not\\nnonfunctional\\u2014characteristics. These cases then determined whether the proscribed class of\\nweapons was dangerous and unusual by assessing whether that class of weapons was particularly\\nuseful for unlawful purposes (dangerous) and whether it was uncommon for lawful purposes\\n(unusual). Putting this all together, we see that history and tradition permit the government to ban\\nthe possession or carry of certain classes of weapon, as defined by their shared functional features,\\nif those classes are dangerous and unusual.\\u201d) (citations omitted).\\n\\n        More to the point, these laws and the decisions interpreting them set out a guiding historic\\nprinciple that appears uniform amongst a majority of States: brass knuckles are dangerous and\\nunusual weapons that have not, from 1791 through the post-Civil War era, played a role in the\\ndefense of self or others. As two esteemed academics recently noted, this long-held\\ncharacterization of weapons like brass knuckles as dangerous and unusual with no connection to\\nlawful uses, causes them to fall outside the protection of the Second Amendment:\\n\\n              Because of courts\\u2019 exclusive focus on individual self-defense against crime,\\n       the opposite problem is happening in other courts. Many courts are finding that\\n       various weapons are constitutionally protected despite being dangerous concealable\\n       weapons with no public-defense value. Some courts have invalidated bans on\\n       switchblade knives, dirk knives, butterfly knives, and nunchucks. A district court,\\n       for example, found that \\u201c[t]he centuries-old history of nunchaku being used as\\n       defensive weapons strongly suggests their possession, like the possession of\\n       firearms, is at the core of the Second Amendment.\\u201d\\n\\n              A general-law approach would make quick work of these cases. The same\\n       law that would find assault weapons within the core of the right to keep and bear\\n       arms would exclude these weapons. These weapons \\u201cbelong to no military\\n       vocabulary\\u201d; they are not arms useful for public defense. Nor are these weapons\\n       \\u201cappropriate for open and manly use in self-defense,\\u201d as are shotguns and similar\\n       firearms. The general law did not afford constitutional protection to small,\\n       dangerous weapons primarily designed as concealed weapons. While one can find\\n       a few outlier decisions to the contrary, the great weight of authority holds that such\\n       weapons are not \\u201carms\\u201d within the meaning of the Second Amendment.

This holds true because there is an application\\nof the statute that is constitutional under the Second Amendment: MCL 750.224(1)(d)\\u2019s ban on\\n\\n\\n                                                -17-\\n\\fthe possession of metallic knuckles falls within the historical tradition of prohibiting the concealed\\ncarry of metallic knuckles as a dangerous and unusual weapon.

BACKGROUND\\n\\n       As noted, defendant was charged with (among other things) a violation of MCL\\n750.224(1)(d), for possessing metallic knuckles. Defendant moved the trial court to dismiss that\\ncharge, arguing that facially, and as applied to him, that statutory prohibition violates both the\\nSecond Amendment to the United States Constitution, US Const, Am II, and Article 1, \\u00a7 6 of the\\nMichigan Constitution, Const 1963, art 1, \\u00a7 6, and their protection of an individual\\u2019s right to keep\\nand bear arms.\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n People v Dummer, unpublished order of the Court of Appeals, entered July 17, 2024 (Docket\\nNo. 369752).\\n\\n\\n                                                -1-\\n\\f         The trial court denied defendant\\u2019s motion, concluding that his argument failed because: (1)\\ndefendant was not challenging the entirety of MCL 750.224, and therefore could not be successful\\nin his facial challenge; (2) metallic knuckles had regularly been viewed as used by criminals or for\\nimproper purposes and were \\u201cdangerous and unusual\\u201d; and (3) metallic knuckles were not\\nprimarily a self-defense weapon.

First, they confirm that from approximately 1845 until the\\n1890s states enacted numerous prohibitions of varying types on metallic knuckles. As recounted\\nabove, most focused on precluding concealed carry, while others focused on sale bans or simple\\npossession. But in all, during this pre-and-post Civil War time period, almost 25 jurisdictions had\\nsome type of restriction on the possession or sale of metallic knuckles. See also Kopel &amp; Greenlee,\\nThe History of Bans on Types of Arms Before 1900, 50 Journal of Legislation 223, 360-364 (2024).\\nSecond, these laws show that these jurisdictions considered metallic knuckles to be dangerous and\\nunusual, and not used by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes; instead, they were mainly used\\nby the criminal element.\\n\\n         In analyzing these mid-to-late nineteenth century laws, we acknowledge that \\u201cbecause\\npost-Civil War discussions of the right to keep and bear arms \\u2018took place 75 years after the\\nratification of the Second Amendment, they do not provide as much insight into its original\\nmeaning as earlier sources.\\u2019 \\u201d Bruen, 597 US at 36-37, quoting Heller, </pre><span class=\\\"citation\\\" data-id=\\\"145777\\\"><a href=\\\"/opinion/145777/district-of-columbia-v-heller/#614\\\" aria-description=\\\"Citation for case: District of Columbia v.

As two esteemed academics recently noted, this long-held\\ncharacterization of weapons like brass knuckles as dangerous and unusual with no connection to\\nlawful uses, causes them to fall outside the protection of the Second Amendment:\\n\\n              Because of courts\\u2019 exclusive focus on individual self-defense against crime,\\n       the opposite problem is happening in other courts. Many courts are finding that\\n       various weapons are constitutionally protected despite being dangerous concealable\\n       weapons with no public-defense value. Some courts have invalidated bans on\\n       switchblade knives, dirk knives, butterfly knives, and nunchucks. A district court,\\n       for example, found that \\u201c[t]he centuries-old history of nunchaku being used as\\n       defensive weapons strongly suggests their possession, like the possession of\\n       firearms, is at the core of the Second Amendment.\\u201d\\n\\n              A general-law approach would make quick work of these cases. The same\\n       law that would find assault weapons within the core of the right to keep and bear\\n       arms would exclude these weapons. These weapons \\u201cbelong to no military\\n       vocabulary\\u201d; they are not arms useful for public defense. Nor are these weapons\\n       \\u201cappropriate for open and manly use in self-defense,\\u201d as are shotguns and similar\\n       firearms. The general law did not afford constitutional protection to small,\\n       dangerous weapons primarily designed as concealed weapons. While one can find\\n       a few outlier decisions to the contrary, the great weight of authority holds that such\\n       weapons are not \\u201carms\\u201d within the meaning of the Second Amendment.

The trial court originally sentenced\\ndefendant to mandatory life in prison without the possibility of parole, but following the decisions\\nof the United States Supreme Court in Miller v Alabama, 567 US 460; 132 S Ct 2455; 183 L Ed\\n2d 407 (2012), and Montgomery v Louisiana, 577 US 190; 136 S Ct 718; 193 L Ed 2d 599 (2016),\\nand our Legislature\\u2019s enactment of MCL 769.25 and MCL 769.25a, defendant was entitled to be\\nresentenced. The prosecution moved to resentence defendant to life without parole under MCL\\n769.25(2), and in accordance with MCL 769.25(6), the trial court held a hearing on the\\nprosecution\\u2019s motion. At the start of the second day of that hearing, before defendant presented\\nhis evidence, defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to the proceed with the\\nremainder of the hearing. In so doing, defendant affirmatively stated that he understood that a\\nconsequence of his decision was that he would not be opposing the prosecution\\u2019s motion to\\nsentence him to life without parole, and he affirmed that he was \\u201cin agreement with that.\\u201d\\nFollowing defendant\\u2019s clear and unequivocal waiver, the trial court resentenced defendant to life\\nwithout parole. Defendant appeals that sentence as of right. We affirm.\\n\\n                                       I. BACKGROUND\\n\\n         One morning in 1982, when defendant was 16 years old, he rode his bike to the Guiliani\\nfamily\\u2019s home, carrying a rifle on the bike\\u2019s handlebars. Once at the home, defendant shot and\\nkilled five members of the Giuliani family\\u2014the mother and her four children. The youngest victim\\nwas nine years old. The father of the Giuliani family was at work at the time. Following\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                -1-\\n\\fdefendant\\u2019s arrest and trial, he was convicted of five counts of first-degree murder and five counts\\nof felony-firearm. On March 14, 1983, defendant was sentenced to mandatory life without parole.\\n\\n       Following changes in the law brought about by the United States Supreme Court\\u2019s\\ndecisions in Miller and Montgomery, as well as our Legislature\\u2019s enactment of MCL 769.25 and\\nMCL 769.25a, the prosecution moved to resentence defendant to life without parole under MCL\\n769.25(2). After many adjournments, the trial court held a hearing on the prosecution\\u2019s motion\\n(the Miller hearing) pursuant to MCL 769.25(6). On the first day of the Miller hearing, the court\\nheard testimony from the original police detective assigned to defendant\\u2019s case, friends of the\\nGiuliani family, and defendant\\u2019s friend who was with him following the murders. This testimony\\ngenerally established the circumstances surrounding the 1982 murders and defendant\\u2019s behavior\\nafterwards.\\n\\n        At the start of the second day of the Miller hearing, defense counsel informed the court that\\ndefendant did \\u201cnot wish to proceed with the Miller Hearing\\u201d any further. Defendant was then\\nsworn in and was questioned by his counsel. After confirming that he understood that he had a\\nright to the Miller hearing, defendant said, \\u201cI am waiving it,\\u201d and that he did not wish to proceed\\nwith the hearing any further. Upon questioning by the trial court, defendant again confirmed that\\nhe was waiving his right to the Miller hearing. Then the following exchange took place:\\n\\n              The Court. Do you understand that by waiving this hearing in effect there\\n       would be no opposition being mounted against the People\\u2019s motion to have me\\n       resentence you to life in prison without the possibility of parole?\\n\\n               The Defendant. Yes, sir.\\n\\n              The Court: So you know that that essentially is the ultimate consequence\\n       of your decision to waive that hearing today?\\n\\n               The Defendant: Yes, sir.\\n\\n               The Court: And you\\u2019re, you\\u2019re in agreement with that, are you?\\n\\n               The Defendant: Yes, sir.\\n\\nThe court accepted defendant\\u2019s waiver and turned to addressing the prosecution\\u2019s motion to\\nsentence defendant to life without parole. The court reasoned that, because there was \\u201cno\\nopposition\\u201d to the motion, the court would grant it.\\n\\n         The court then immediately proceeded to \\u201ca formal resentencing hearing.\\u201d The court\\ncommended everyone\\u2019s work on the case and said that it originally thought it \\u201cwas going to have\\nto make a decision as to whether [defendant] would remain in prison for the rest of his life\\u201d but\\ndefendant \\u201csettled that question for us.\\u201d The court then mentioned the severity of the crimes for\\nwhich defendant was convicted and highlighted the \\u201creach\\u201d of those crimes, explaining that\\ndefendant\\u2019s crimes had an impact on the entire community. The court concluded by reaffirming\\nthat it was granting the prosecution\\u2019s motion, and it sentenced defendant to life without parole.\\n\\n       This appeal followed.\\n\\n\\n                                                -2-\\n\\f                                  II. DEFENDANT\\u2019S APPEAL\\n\\n        Defendant argues on appeal that \\u201cthe trial court abused its discretion when it re-sentenced\\n[defendant] to life without parole without making the required findings.\\u201d It is unclear from\\ndefendant\\u2019s briefing exactly what \\u201cfindings\\u201d defendant believes the trial court was \\u201crequired\\u201d to\\nmake,1 but it appears defendant is referring to the requirements in MCL 769.25(6) and (7).2 Those\\nsubsections require a trial court contemplating whether to sentence a juvenile offender to life\\nwithout parole to hold a Miller hearing, at which the court is to consider the Miller factors and to\\nstate on the record the circumstances that the court considered and its reasoning for the sentence\\nimposed. MCL 769.25(6) and (7). The subsections state:\\n\\n                (6) If the prosecuting attorney files a motion under subsection (2), the court\\n       shall conduct a hearing on the motion as part of the sentencing process. At the\\n       hearing, the trial court shall consider the factors listed in Miller v Alabama, 576\\n       US_____; 183 L Ed 2d 407; 132 S Ct 2455 (2012), and may consider any other\\n       criteria relevant to its decision, including the individual\\u2019s record while incarcerated.\\n\\n               (7) At the hearing under subsection (6), the court shall specify on the record\\n       the aggravating and mitigating circumstances considered by the court and the\\n       court\\u2019s reasons supporting the sentence imposed. The court may consider evidence\\n       presented at trial together with any evidence presented at the sentencing hearing.\\n\\n        Subsection (7)\\u2019s requirement that the court specify certain findings \\u201con the record\\u201d is, by\\nthe statute\\u2019s plain language, to be done \\u201c[a]t the hearing under subsection (6).\\u201d MCL 769.25(7).\\n\\n\\n1\\n  For instance, defendant\\u2019s brief discusses the United States Supreme Court\\u2019s decision in Miller,\\nits pronouncement of the Miller factors, and cases from this Court and the Michigan Supreme\\nCourt discussing Miller and the Miller factors, but defendant does not contend that Miller or the\\nEighth Amendment required the trial court here to make any particular finding. This is presumably\\nbecause such an argument would lack merit. See People v Skinner, 502 Mich 89, 125; 917 NW2d\\n292 (2018) (explaining that \\u201cthe Eighth Amendment does not require the finding of any particular\\nfact before imposing a life-without-parole sentence\\u201d on a juvenile offenders); People v Hyatt, 316\\nMich App 368, 384; 891 NW2d 549 (2016), rev\\u2019d in part on other grounds by Skinner, 502 Mich\\n89 (explaining that Miller lacked any \\u201cexpress procedural requirements or fact-finding\\nrequirements,\\u201d which is why the Montgomery Court \\u201cemphasized that it was incumbent on states\\nto develop procedures to enforce Miller\\u2019s substantive guarantee\\u201d for juvenile offenders).\\n        Defendant does, at one point, argue that the trial court was required to \\u201cdetermine[] that\\n[defendant] was one of those rare juveniles\\u201d for whom a sentence of life without parole was proper,\\nbut this argument ignores our Supreme Court\\u2019s clear statement that a trial court does not have to\\nfind that a juvenile offender is \\u201crare\\u201d before sentencing him or her to life without parole. See\\nSkinner, 502 Mich at 128 (\\u201cThe trial court also does not have to explicitly find that defendant is\\n\\u2018rare.\\u2019 Indeed, we cannot even imagine how a trial court would go about determining whether a\\nparticular defendant is \\u2018rare\\u2019 or not.\\u201d).\\n2\\n While not dispositive, this is also how the prosecution interprets defendant\\u2019s argument on appeal,\\nand defendant never filed a reply contesting the prosecution\\u2019s interpretation.\\n\\n\\n                                                 -3-\\n\\fYet, here, before the trial court had an opportunity to make the required findings, defendant\\nunequivocally waived his right to the remainder of the hearing. Additionally, the requirements of\\nMCL 769.25(6) and (7) generally establish the process that courts are to follow when deciding\\nwhether to sentence a juvenile offender to life without parole. Yet, here, defendant affirmed that\\na consequence of his waiver was that he would be resentenced to life without parole, and he further\\naffirmed that he was \\u201cin agreement with that.\\u201d Taken as a whole, these facts suggest that defendant\\nwaived the requirements of MCL 769.25(6) and (7).\\n\\n        No published decision in this state has considered whether a defendant can waive the\\nprotections afforded by MCL 769.25(6) and (7), and if so, how. On the one hand, \\u201c[i]t is presumed\\nthat waiver is available in a broad array of constitutional and statutory provisions[.]\\u201d People v\\nCarter, 462 Mich 206, 217-218; 612 NW2d 144 (2000) (quotation marks and citation omitted).\\nOn the other hand, \\u201c[w]hether a particular right is waivable; whether the defendant must participate\\npersonally in the waiver; whether certain procedures are required for waiver; and whether the\\ndefendant\\u2019s choice must be particularly informed or voluntary, all depend on the right at stake.\\u201d\\nId. at 217 (quotation marks and citation omitted). It follows that whether a juvenile offender can\\nwaive the requirements of MCL 769.25(6) and (7)\\u2014and, if so, how\\u2014\\u201cdepends on the right at\\nstake.\\u201d Id.\\n\\n         Resolution of whether defendant could and validly did waive the requirements of MCL\\n769.25(6) and (7) is potentially dispositive\\u2014if defendant can and did waive the requirements of\\nMCL 769.25(6) and (7), then defendant\\u2019s appeal based on the trial court\\u2019s failure to fulfill the\\nrequirements of those subsections cannot proceed. See id. at 215 (\\u201cOne who waives his rights\\nunder a rule may not then seek appellate review of a claimed deprivation of those rights, for his\\nwaiver has extinguished any error.\\u201d) (Quotation marks and citation omitted.) Defendant does not\\naddress whether a waiver of the \\u201cprocedural mechanisms\\u201d3 under MCL 769.25 is proper in the\\nfirst instance, jumping only to the question: what are the responsibilities of a sentencing court\\nfollowing a valid waiver of a Miller hearing? As a result, any argument about whether a defendant\\ncould not waive the requirements of MCL 769.25(6) and (7) is saved for another day.4\\n\\n       This makes resolution of this appeal straightforward. At his Miller hearing, defendant\\nknowingly, voluntarily, and unequivocally waived his right to the remainder of the Miller hearing\\nand agreed that the likely consequence of his decision was that he would be resentenced to life\\nwithout parole. By so doing, defendant effectively waived the requirements of MCL 769.25(6)\\nand (7). And because defendant was no longer opposing the prosecution\\u2019s motion to resentence\\nhim to life without parole, the trial court sentenced defendant to life without parole. On appeal,\\ndefendant argues that the trial court erred by sentencing him to life without parole without making\\n\\n\\n3\\n People v Taylor, 510 Mich 112, 129; 987 NW2d 132 (2022) (describing the statutory regime in\\nMichigan as \\u201cadditional sentencing limits . . . and procedural mechanisms\\u201d beyond that required\\nby Miller v Alabama, 567 US 460, 132 S Ct 2455 (2012) and Jones v Mississippi, 593 US 98, 141\\nS Ct 1307 (2021)).\\n4\\n  At oral argument and in briefing, appellate counsel conceded that the waiver itself was knowing,\\nintelligent, and voluntary on the basis of the record as well as her conversations with defendant\\nand Miller-hearing counsel.\\n\\n\\n                                                -4-\\n\\fthe findings required by MCL 769.25(6) and (7). But, again, defendant waived the requirements\\nof MCL 769.25(6) and (7), and on appeal, defendant has abandoned any argument that he could\\nnot or did not validly waive his rights under those subsections because he failed to adequately brief\\nthe issue. See Mitcham v City of Detroit, 355 Mich 182, 203; 94 NW2d 388 (1959). We\\naccordingly conclude that defendant\\u2019s waiver of those statutory subsections\\u2019 requirements\\nextinguished any error, and he cannot now \\u201cseek appellate review of a claimed deprivation of those\\nrights.\\u201d Carter, 462 Mich at 215.\\n\\n        Finally, even if we were to treat defendant\\u2019s claim \\u201cas merely forfeited rather than\\naffirmatively waived,\\u201d People v Flores, 346 Mich App 602, 608-609; 13 NW3d 668 (2023), we\\nwould still conclude that there was no reversible error here. Defendant did not object to (a) the\\ntrial court\\u2019s comment that defendant\\u2019s decision not to go forward with the hearing \\u201csettled that\\nquestion for us,\\u201d or (b) the trial court\\u2019s decision to reimpose life without the possibility of parole.\\nAccordingly, under the familiar Carines plain-error standard, defendant would have to show,\\namong other things, that his substantial rights were affected.

BACKGROUND\\n\\n         One morning in 1982, when defendant was 16 years old, he rode his bike to the Guiliani\\nfamily\\u2019s home, carrying a rifle on the bike\\u2019s handlebars. Once at the home, defendant shot and\\nkilled five members of the Giuliani family\\u2014the mother and her four children. The youngest victim\\nwas nine years old. The father of the Giuliani family was at work at the time. Following\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                -1-\\n\\fdefendant\\u2019s arrest and trial, he was convicted of five counts of first-degree murder and five counts\\nof felony-firearm. On March 14, 1983, defendant was sentenced to mandatory life without parole.\\n\\n       Following changes in the law brought about by the United States Supreme Court\\u2019s\\ndecisions in Miller and Montgomery, as well as our Legislature\\u2019s enactment of MCL 769.25 and\\nMCL 769.25a, the prosecution moved to resentence defendant to life without parole under MCL\\n769.25(2). After many adjournments, the trial court held a hearing on the prosecution\\u2019s motion\\n(the Miller hearing) pursuant to MCL 769.25(6). On the first day of the Miller hearing, the court\\nheard testimony from the original police detective assigned to defendant\\u2019s case, friends of the\\nGiuliani family, and defendant\\u2019s friend who was with him following the murders. This testimony\\ngenerally established the circumstances surrounding the 1982 murders and defendant\\u2019s behavior\\nafterwards.\\n\\n        At the start of the second day of the Miller hearing, defense counsel informed the court that\\ndefendant did \\u201cnot wish to proceed with the Miller Hearing\\u201d any further. Defendant was then\\nsworn in and was questioned by his counsel. After confirming that he understood that he had a\\nright to the Miller hearing, defendant said, \\u201cI am waiving it,\\u201d and that he did not wish to proceed\\nwith the hearing any further. Upon questioning by the trial court, defendant again confirmed that\\nhe was waiving his right to the Miller hearing. Then the following exchange took place:\\n\\n              The Court. Do you understand that by waiving this hearing in effect there\\n       would be no opposition being mounted against the People\\u2019s motion to have me\\n       resentence you to life in prison without the possibility of parole?\\n\\n               The Defendant. Yes, sir.\\n\\n              The Court: So you know that that essentially is the ultimate consequence\\n       of your decision to waive that hearing today?\\n\\n               The Defendant: Yes, sir.\\n\\n               The Court: And you\\u2019re, you\\u2019re in agreement with that, are you?\\n\\n               The Defendant: Yes, sir.\\n\\nThe court accepted defendant\\u2019s waiver and turned to addressing the prosecution\\u2019s motion to\\nsentence defendant to life without parole. The court reasoned that, because there was \\u201cno\\nopposition\\u201d to the motion, the court would grant it.\\n\\n         The court then immediately proceeded to \\u201ca formal resentencing hearing.\\u201d The court\\ncommended everyone\\u2019s work on the case and said that it originally thought it \\u201cwas going to have\\nto make a decision as to whether [defendant] would remain in prison for the rest of his life\\u201d but\\ndefendant \\u201csettled that question for us.\\u201d The court then mentioned the severity of the crimes for\\nwhich defendant was convicted and highlighted the \\u201creach\\u201d of those crimes, explaining that\\ndefendant\\u2019s crimes had an impact on the entire community. The court concluded by reaffirming\\nthat it was granting the prosecution\\u2019s motion, and it sentenced defendant to life without parole.\\n\\n       This appeal followed.\\n\\n\\n                                                -2-\\n\\f                                  II.

Under the National Clean Investment Fund\\n\\n(\\u201cNCIF\\u201d), Climate United was awarded $6.97 billion, CGC was awarded $5 billion, and PFC was\\n\\nawarded $2 billion.

ANALYSIS\\n\\n       The court finds that, on the record currently before it, Plaintiffs are entitled to a temporary\\n\\nrestraining order.\\n\\n   A. Jurisdiction\\n\\n       First, EPA Defendants argue that the court lacks jurisdiction to hear this case because \\u201cthe\\n\\nrelief Plaintiff seeks is entirely contractual in nature\\u201d and \\u201creally amounts to a breach-of-contract\\n\\nclaim.\\u201d Defs.\\u2019 Opp\\u2019n at 15. According to EPA Defendants, jurisdiction therefore lies in the Court\\n\\nof Federal Claims. At the March 17 hearing, EPA Defendants re-iterated this position for all\\n\\nPlaintiffs. This argument is unavailing.\\n\\n       Under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1491, the Court of Federal Claims has exclusive\\n\\njurisdiction over certain contract and monetary claims against the government. But the D.C.\\n\\nCircuit has \\u201cexplicitly rejected the \\u2018broad\\u2019 notion \\u2018that any case requiring some reference to or\\n\\nincorporation of a contract is necessarily on the contract and therefore directly within the Tucker\\n\\nAct\\u2019 because to do so would \\u2018deny a court jurisdiction to consider a claim that is validly based on\\n\\ngrounds other than a contractual relationship with the government.\\u2019\\u201d Crowley Gov\\u2019t Servs., Inc.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                           Page 10 of 23\\n\\fv.

Cir. 1982)).\\n\\n         In determining whether a claim falls under the Tucker Act the court must decide if the\\n\\naction \\u201cis at its essence a contract claim.\\u201d Id. at 1106 (quoting Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 967). The\\n\\nD.C. Circuit has instructed that \\u201cwhether a claim is \\u2018at its essence\\u2019 contractual\\u201d depends \\u201cboth on\\n\\nthe source of the rights upon which the plaintiff bases its claims, and upon the type of relief sought\\n\\n(or appropriate).\\u201d Id. (quoting Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968).\\n\\n         Plaintiffs\\u2019 claims are not at their \\u201cessence contractual.\\u201d Plaintiffs sued Citibank and EPA\\n\\nDefendants after Citibank refused to release their grant funds and after EPA Defendants\\n\\nunilaterally terminated these grants, without giving Plaintiffs any meaningful opportunity to be\\n\\nheard.    They challenge the unlawful terminations and EPA\\u2019s failure to take the necessary\\n\\nprocedural steps before terminating the grant awards. Plaintiffs do not challenge a contract\\n\\nbetween the parties\\u2014they challenge an action. And \\u201cexclusive jurisdiction in Claims Court under\\n\\nthe Tucker Act does not lie \\u2018merely because [a plaintiff] hints at some interest in a monetary reward\\n\\nfrom the federal government or because success on the merits may obligate the United States to\\n\\npay the complainant.\\u2019\\u201d Id. at 1108 (quoting Kidwell v. Dep\\u2019t of Army, 56 F.3d 279, 284 (D.C. Cir.\\n\\n1995)). This court has jurisdiction over the alleged due process and \\u201carbitrary and capricious\\u201d\\n\\nagency actions under the U.S. Constitution and the APA, 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 702.\\n\\n         Moreover, Plaintiffs were awarded this grant pursuant to a statute authorized by Congress.\\n\\nAs the Supreme Court has noted, \\u201c[u]nlike normal contractual undertakings, federal grant\\n\\nprograms originate in and remain governed by statutory provisions expressing the judgment of\\n\\nCongress concerning desirable public policy.\\u201d Bennett v. Kentucky Dept. of Educ., 470 U.S. 656,\\n\\n669 (1985). Plaintiffs\\u2019 \\u201cclaims arise under a federal grant program and turn on the interpretation\\n\\n\\n\\n                                           Page 11 of 23\\n\\fof statutes and regulations rather than on the interpretation of an agreement negotiated by the\\n\\nparties.\\u201d Maryland Dep\\u2019t of Hum. Res. v. Dep\\u2019t of Health & Hum. Servs., 763 F.2d 1441, 1449\\n\\n(D.C. Cir. 1985) (citation omitted). EPA Defendants\\u2019 termination of these grants appears to\\n\\ncontravene a duly enacted statute and interferes with Plaintiffs\\u2019 statutory rights to these funds.\\n\\n       At bottom, Plaintiffs do not bring simple breach of contract claims\\u2014they challenge adverse\\n\\nagency action. Plaintiffs neither seek money damages nor ask the court to interpret the terms of\\n\\nany contract. They instead ask the court to determine whether EPA Defendants\\u2019 actions in\\n\\nterminating the grant were, as EPA Defendants contend, \\u201creasonable and in compliance with\\n\\nEPA\\u2019s rights under the Grant Agreement.\\u201d Defs.\\u2019 Opp\\u2019n at 15. A decision on that issue would\\n\\nenable Plaintiffs to avail themselves \\u201cof statutory and regulatory provisions and procedures that\\n\\nmay, or may not, entitle [it] to a monetary recovery.\\u201d Tootle v. Sec\\u2019y of Navy, 446 F.3d 167, 175\\n\\n(D.C. Cir. 2006) (collecting authorities).\\n\\n       Finally, cases \\u201chave long recognized\\u201d that \\u201c[t]he fact that a judicial remedy may require\\n\\none party to pay money to another is not a sufficient reason to characterize the relief as \\u2018money\\n\\ndamages.\\u2019\\u201d Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 893 (1988). Indeed, \\u201ca claim is not for money\\n\\nmerely because its success may lead to pecuniary costs for the government or benefits for the\\n\\nplaintiff.\\u201d Kidwell, 56 F.3d at 285; see Vietnam Veterans v. Sec\\u2019y of the Navy, 843 F.2d 528, 534\\n\\n(D.C. Cir. 1988). And as is true here, any monetary benefit that might flow to Plaintiffs \\u201cwould\\n\\nnot come from this court\\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction, but from the structure of statutory and\\n\\nregulatory requirements governing compensation\\u201d in this action.

The fact that EPA Defendants have done one of\\n\\nthe things that Plaintiffs sought to enjoin\\u2014unilaterally terminated their grants\\u2014does not mean the\\n\\ncontroversy no longer exists. In fact, there is perhaps even more of a controversy over Plaintiffs\\u2019\\n\\nparticular legal rights here. As discussed above, and at the very least, there are serious due process\\n\\nconcerns and questions of whether EPA Defendants\\u2019 actions were \\u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse\\n\\nof discretion, [] otherwise not in accordance with law,\\u201d contrary to statute, or unsupported by\\n\\nsubstantial evidence in violation of the APA, 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 706(2).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n  While EPA Defendants did not address mootness at the March 17 hearing, the court addresses\\nthe argument and addresses it as to all Plaintiffs.\\n\\n                                           Page 13 of 23\\n\\f    C.

In its Climate United opposition, EPA Defendants counter\\n\\nthat its termination of the grant was \\u201ceminently reasonable\\u2014not arbitrary and capricious,\\u201d and\\n\\n\\u201cthe only responsible course in the interim [] to suspend further grant disbursements that might\\n\\notherwise be unrecoverable.\\u201d Defs.\\u2019 Opp\\u2019n at 21. But based on the record before the court, and\\n\\nunder the relevant statutes and various agreements, it does not appear that EPA Defendants took\\n\\nthe legally required steps necessary to terminate these grants, such that its actions were arbitrary\\n\\nand capricious.

Am.\\n\\nCompl., Dkt. 8. He alleges that WMATA took various retaliatory and discriminatory actions in\\n\\nresponse to him exercising his FMLA rights. Before the Court is WMATA\\u2019s Motion to Dismiss\\n\\nthis action under Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or, in the alternative, under\\n\\nRule 12(b)(6). 1 Dkt. 17. For the reasons that follow, the Court will grant WMATA\\u2019s motion.\\n\\nI.      BACKGROUND\\n\\n        Tillmon has been employed by WMATA since at least 2017, first as a train operator, Am.\\n\\nCompl. \\u00b6 4, and later as a bus operator, id. \\u00b6 1. Tillmon first \\u201capplied and was approved for\\n\\nFMLA\\u201d in 2017. Id. \\u00b6 4. In June 2023, \\u201cdue to the overwhelming stress and demand\\u201d of the job,\\n\\n\\n1\\n  Although WMATA styles its motion as one to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of\\njurisdiction, it argues in the alternative that Tillmon has failed to allege a family-care-related\\nmedical leave claim under the FMLA, Mot. to Dismiss, at 5 n.1, Dkt. 17. Because the Court will\\nconstrue Tillmon\\u2019s pro se complaint liberally to assert a family-care-related medical leave claim,\\nit will also address WMATA\\u2019s alternate argument under Rule 12(b)(6).\\n\\fhe sought to be approved for FMLA a second time. Id. By July 17, Tillmon was notified that \\u201chis\\n\\nFMLA was approved for taking a full day off work twice per month per [his] doctor\\u2019s request for\\n\\n[Tillmon\\u2019s] mental health condition.\\u201d Id. \\u00b6 6.\\n\\n       Tilllmon used his approved two monthly days off throughout the fall of 2023. Id. \\u00b6\\u00b6 7\\u201324.\\n\\nIn October, Tillmon called in \\u201cto be absent for Family Sick\\u201d because his \\u201cson was involved in a\\n\\ncar accident.\\u201d Id. \\u00b6 14. He ended up taking \\u201cfive days [off] to care for his son.\\u201d Id. When Tillmon\\n\\nreturned to work, WMATA required him to undergo drug and alcohol testing. Id. \\u00b6 15.\\n\\n       WMATA later placed Tillmon on administrative leave while they investigated an incident\\n\\nrelated to improper operation of a train. Id. \\u00b6\\u00b6 25\\u201327. Based on the results of that investigation,\\n\\nTillmon was \\u201cdisqualified and terminated as a Train Operator,\\u201d and was placed on leave without\\n\\npay. Id. \\u00b6 28. Tillmon maintains that the findings in the investigation report are \\u201cerroneous.\\u201d Id..\\n\\nIn February 2024, he returned to work for WMATA as a bus operator. Id. \\u00b6 32. Tillmon alleges\\n\\nthat WMATA continued to discriminate against him because of his FMLA accommodation after\\n\\nhe resumed work as a bus operator. Id. \\u00b6\\u00b6 33\\u201339.\\n\\n       Tillmon initiated this lawsuit on April 23, 2024, and filed his amended complaint on May\\n\\n14, 2024. Dkts. 1, 8. He alleges that he was subject to \\u201cunwarranted scrutiny, disciplinary\\n\\nmeasures, and retaliatory practices\\u201d because of \\u201chis requests for medical leave and\\n\\naccommodations.\\u201d Opp\\u2019n, at 1, Dkt. 19. WMATA missed the answer deadline, and Tillmon\\n\\nmoved several times for entry of default judgment. Dkts. 10, 11, 12. The Court initially entered\\n\\ndefault judgment, but the default was ultimately excused. Dkt. 13; Minute Order of June 13, 2024.\\n\\nWMATA then filed this motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, or in the alternative, for failure\\n\\nto state a claim. Dkt. 17.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                 2\\n\\fII.    LEGAL STANDARDS\\n\\n       Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), a defendant may move to dismiss an action\\n\\nfor lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). Because \\u201c[s]overeign immunity\\n\\nis jurisdictional in nature,\\u201d FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 475 (1994), claims barred by the United\\n\\nStates\\u2019 sovereign immunity are \\u201csubject to dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1),\\u201d Clayton v. District of\\n\\nColumbia, 931 F. Supp. 2d 192, 200 (D.D.C. 2013). When reviewing a motion to dismiss for lack\\n\\nof jurisdiction, the court must \\u201cassume the truth of all material factual allegations in the complaint\\n\\nand construe the complaint liberally.\\u201d Am. Nat. Ins. Co. v. FDIC, 642 F.3d 1137, 1139 (D.C. Cir.\\n\\n2011) (internal quotation marks omitted).       At the same time, plaintiffs bear the burden of\\n\\nestablishing subject-matter jurisdiction, see Arpaio v. Obama, 797 F.3d 11, 19 (D.C. Cir. 2015),\\n\\nand courts must raise obstacles to their jurisdiction sua sponte, see Fort Bend Cty. v. Davis, 587\\n\\nU.S. 541, 548 (2019). \\u201c[W]hile complaints filed by pro se litigants are held to a less stringent\\n\\nstandard than those applied to formal pleadings drafted by lawyers, even a pro se plaintiff bears\\n\\nthe burden of establishing that the Court has subject matter jurisdiction.\\u201d Newby v. Obama, 681\\n\\nF. Supp. 2d 53, 55 (D.D.C. 2010) (cleaned up).\\n\\n       Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allows a defendant to move to\\n\\ndismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Fed. R. Civ. P.\\n\\n12(b)(6). To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a complaint must contain factual matter sufficient to\\n\\n\\u201cstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\\u201d Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570\\n\\n(2007). A facially plausible claim is one that \\u201callows the court to draw the reasonable inference\\n\\nthat the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\\u201d Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678\\n\\n(2009). This standard does not amount to a specific probability requirement, but it does require\\n\\n\\u201cmore than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.\\u201d Id.; see also Twombly, 550\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                  3\\n\\fU.S. at 555 (\\u201cFactual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative\\n\\nlevel.\\u201d). A complaint need not contain \\u201cdetailed factual allegations,\\u201d Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678, but\\n\\nalleging facts that are \\u201cmerely consistent with a defendant\\u2019s liability . . . stops short of the line\\n\\nbetween possibility and plausibility,\\u201d id. (internal quotation marks omitted).\\n\\nIII.   ANALYSIS\\n\\n       WMATA moves to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\\n\\nDkt. 17. It claims that sovereign immunity generally bars Tillmon\\u2019s ADA and FMLA claims.\\n\\nThough WMATA acknowledges that States cannot claim sovereign immunity for FMLA family-\\n\\ncare claims, it argues that Tillmon has not properly raised one, Mot. to Dismiss at 4\\u20135, which the\\n\\nCourt will address under Rule 12(b)(6).\\n\\n       A.      Rule 12(b)(1)\\n\\n       \\u201cThe ultimate guarantee of the Eleventh Amendment is that nonconsenting States may not\\n\\nbe sued by private individuals in federal court.\\u201d Bd. of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531\\n\\nU.S. 356, 363 (2001) (citing Kimel v. Fla. Bd. of Regents, 528 U.S. 62, 73 (2000)). \\u201c[M]oney\\n\\ndamages are the exception when sovereigns are defendants.\\u201d Coleman v. Ct. of Appeals of Md.,\\n\\n566 U.S. 30, 43 (2012). The test for determining if a State has consented to suit in federal court\\n\\n\\u201cis a stringent one.\\u201d Coll. Sav. Bank v. Fla. Prepaid Postsecondary Educ. Expense Bd., 527 U.S.\\n\\n666, 675 (1999) (cleaned up). It requires a \\u201cclear declaration of [the State\\u2019s] intent to submit to\\n\\nfederal court jurisdiction.\\u201d Barbour v. WMATA, 374 F.3d 1161, 1163 (D.C. Cir. 2004). Absent a\\n\\nwaiver of sovereign immunity, Congress may abrogate States\\u2019 sovereign immunity only if it\\n\\n\\u201cunequivocally intends to do so and acts pursuant to a valid grant of constitutional authority.\\u201d\\n\\nGarrett, 531 U.S. at 363 (cleaned up).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                 4\\n\\f       WMATA generally possesses sovereign immunity. WMATA was \\u201ccreated by a compact\\u201d\\n\\nbetween Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia, and with the consent of Congress.\\n\\nJones v. WMATA, 205 F.3d 428, 432 (D.C. Cir. 2000). \\u201c[E]ach [state] conferred its immunity\\n\\nupon WMATA.\\u201d Id. Because ADA claims against States are barred by sovereign immunity, they\\n\\nare also barred against WMATA. Hopps v. WMATA, 480 F. Supp. 2d 243, 256 (D.D.C. 2007)\\n\\n(citing Jones, 205 F.3d at 432). FMLA self-care claims are also barred by sovereign immunity,\\n\\nnotwithstanding Congress\\u2019s intent to abrogate States\\u2019 sovereign immunity for those claims.\\n\\nColeman, 566 U.S. at 37, 43\\u201344; see Jones, 205 F.3d at 432. Thus, because WMATA has not\\n\\nwaived its sovereign immunity or voluntarily invoked federal jurisdiction here, see Lapides v. Bd.\\n\\nof Regents of Univ. Sys. of Ga., 535 U.S. 613, 619 (2002), the plaintiff\\u2019s ADA claims and FMLA\\n\\nself-care claims are barred by sovereign immunity.\\n\\n       Tillmon contends that sovereign immunity does not bar these claims because WMATA\\n\\n\\u201cbenefit[s] from federal funds.\\u201d Opp\\u2019n at 2. He cites to Barbour for the proposition that when\\n\\nStates accept federal funding, they often waive sovereign immunity. It is true that Congress,\\n\\nexercising its Spending Clause powers, may \\u201ccondition the receipt of federal funds on . . . a waiver\\n\\n[of sovereign immunity].\\u201d Barbour, 374 F.3d at 1170. Barbour, however, dealt with the\\n\\nRehabilitation Act, which was enacted under the Spending Clause, 374 F.3d at 1161, not the ADA,\\n\\nwhich was not, Garrett, 531 U.S. at 374. Because States do not receive federal funds under the\\n\\nADA, they have not waived their sovereign immunity with respect to those claims. Id. The\\n\\nRehabilitation Act and the ADA incorporate the same standards of liability and provide similar\\n\\nstatutory protections, see Alexander v. WMATA, 826 F.3d 544, 546 (D.C. Cir. 2016); Austin v.\\n\\nWMATA, No. 19-cv-2718 (DLF), 2020 WL 2962609, at *7 (D.D.C. May 28, 2020), but the\\n\\nplaintiff has only brought an ADA claim, see Am. Compl. \\u00b6\\u00b6 43\\u201351.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                 5\\n\\f       Tillmon also seems to suggest that WMATA may have waived its sovereign immunity\\n\\nbecause it \\u201coperat[es] under federal laws\\u201d and because it voluntarily invoked \\u201cfederal jurisdiction.\\u201d\\n\\nOpp\\u2019n, at 2. But operating under federal law does not constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity.\\n\\nSee Barbour, 374 F.3d at 1163. Nor has WMATA voluntarily invoked federal jurisdiction either\\n\\nby initiating this suit or by removing this action from state to federal court. See Lapides, 535 U.S.\\n\\nat 619. Accordingly, the Court will dismiss Tillmon\\u2019s ADA and FMLA self-care claims under\\n\\nRule 12(b)(1).\\n\\n       Although States have sovereign immunity for ADA and FMLA self-care claims, they do\\n\\nnot have sovereign immunity for family-care claims. Nev. Dep\\u2019t of Hum. Res. v. Hibbs, 538 U.S.\\n\\n721, 740 (2003). The parties agree on this point. See Opp\\u2019n, at 3; Mot. to Dismiss at 5. But the\\n\\nparties disagree as to whether Tillmon has properly pled a family-care claim. See Opp\\u2019n at 3; Mot.\\n\\nto Dismiss at 5.\\n\\n       B.        Rule 12(b)(6)\\n\\n       The government is correct that Tillmon\\u2019s complaint does not explicitly plead an FMLA\\n\\nfamily-care claim. Mot. to Dismiss at 5 n.1. But \\u201ca complaint need not pin plaintiff's claim for\\n\\nrelief to a precise legal theory,\\u201d because Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \\u201cgenerally\\n\\nrequires only a plausible short and plain statement of the plaintiff's claim, not an exposition of his\\n\\nlegal argument.\\u201d Skinner v. Switzer, 562 U.S. 521, 530 (2011) (cleaned up). \\u201cCourts have\\n\\nextended this liberal pleading standard even further for plaintiffs proceeding pro se.\\u201d Spence v.\\n\\nU.S. Dep\\u2019t of Veterans Affs., 109 F.4th 531, 537 (D.C. Cir. 2024), cert. denied sub nom. Spence\\n\\nv. Dep't of Veterans Affs., No. 24-468, 2024 WL 4874689 (U.S. Nov. 25, 2024). As a result,\\n\\n\\u201ccourts must treat technical deficiencies in the complaint leniently and scrutinize the entire\\n\\npleading to determine if any legally cognizable claim can be found.\\u201d Id. at 538 (cleaned up).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                  6\\n\\f       Under the FMLA, it is \\u201cunlawful for any employer to interfere with, restrain, or deny the\\n\\nexercise\\u201d of family-care rights, or to \\u201cdiscriminate against any individual\\u201d for exercising them. 29\\n\\nU.S.C. \\u00a7 2615(a)(1), (2). Plaintiffs alleging FMLA violations can recover only for \\u201ccompensation\\n\\nand benefits lost \\u2018by reason of the violation,\\u2019 for other monetary losses sustained \\u2018as a direct result\\n\\nof the violation,\\u2019 and for \\u2018appropriate\\u2019 equitable relief, including employment, reinstatement, and\\n\\npromotion.\\u201d Ragsdale v. Wolverine World Wide, Inc., 535 U.S. 81, 89 (2002) (quoting 29 U.S.C.\\n\\n\\u00a7 2617(a)(1)(A)(i)(I)-(II), (a)(1)(B)).\\n\\n       The FMLA\\u2019s family-care provisions guarantee that \\u201can eligible employee shall be entitled\\n\\nto a total of 12 workweeks of leave during any 12-month period . . . [i]n order to care for the\\n\\nspouse, or a son, daughter, or parent, of the employee, if such spouse, son, daughter, or parent has\\n\\na serious health condition.\\u201d 29 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2612(a)(1)(C). A serious health condition is defined as\\n\\nan \\u201cillness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition\\u201d that involves \\u201cinpatient care\\u201d or\\n\\n\\u201ccontinuing treatment by a health care provider.\\u201d          29 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2611(11); see 29 C.F.R.\\n\\n\\u00a7 825.113(a); Hodges v. District of Columbia, 959 F. Supp. 2d 148, 155 (D.D.C. 2013).\\n\\nContinuing treatment requires (1) at least four consecutive days of incapacity; (2) at least one \\u201cin-\\n\\nperson treatment visit\\u201d with a health care provider \\u201cwithin seven days of the first day of\\n\\nincapacity;\\u201d and (3) \\u201ca regimen of continuing treatment under the supervision of the health care\\n\\nprovider.\\u201d 29 C.F.R. \\u00a7 825.115(a)(2)\\u2013(3). A serious car accident injury can be considered a severe\\n\\nhealth condition if it results in injuries that require a regimen of continuing treatment, such as\\n\\nphysical therapy, or if it otherwise leaves the victim unable to work. See Cobbs v. Bluemercury,\\n\\nInc., 746 F. Supp. 2d 137, 144 (D.D.C. 2010); Chipman v. Cook, No. 3:15-cv-143 KGB, 2017 WL\\n\\n1160585, at *10 (E.D. Ark. Mar. 28, 2017).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                  7\\n\\f       Construing Tillmon\\u2019s complaint liberally, as this Court must, Spence, 109 F.4th at 538,\\n\\nseveral factual allegations support a family-care claim. Tillmon alleges that his \\u201cson was involved\\n\\nin a car accident,\\u201d Am. Compl. \\u00b6 14; that he took five days off \\u201cto care for his son,\\u201d id.; and that\\n\\nWMATA took an \\u201cadverse administrative action\\u201d by requiring him to \\u201cundergo drug and alcohol\\n\\ntesting\\u201d after he returned to work following a period of caring for his son, id. \\u00b6 47(e).\\n\\n       On these facts, it is plausible that Tillmon\\u2019s son experienced four days of incapacity, which\\n\\nis the first requirement for a health condition to qualify as severe. 29 C.F.R. \\u00a7 825.115(a).\\n\\nAlthough Tillmon does not allege that the car accident injury required an \\u201cin-person treatment\\n\\nvisit\\u201d \\u201cwithin seven days of the first day of incapacity,\\u201d or resulted in a \\u201cregimen of continuing\\n\\ntreatment under the supervision of the health care provider,\\u201d id. \\u00a7 825.115(a)(2)\\u2013(3), serious car\\n\\naccident injuries can qualify as severe health conditions, see Cobbs, 746 F. Supp. 2d at 144. It is\\n\\nalso possible that WMATA\\u2019s alleged retaliatory drug testing resulted in loss of \\u201ccompensation [or]\\n\\nbenefits\\u201d or \\u201cother monetary losses sustained \\u2018as a direct result of the violation.\\u2019\\u201d Ragsdale, 535\\n\\nU.S. at 89 (quoting 29 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2617(a)(1)(A)(i)(I)-(II)). But Tillmon has not alleged that he\\n\\nincurred monetary damages to pay for his drug testing or related transportation costs, or that he\\n\\nwas required to take unpaid leave for testing. See Gordon v. U.S. Capitol Police, 778 F.3d 158,\\n\\n160, 163 (D.C. Cir. 2015). Nor has he alleged facts that could reasonably show equitable relief\\n\\nwould be warranted. Ragsdale, 535 U.S. at 89. Thus, even construing his complaint liberally to\\n\\nallege a FMLA family-care claim, Tillmon has not adequately pled a FMLA family-care claim.\\n\\n       Accordingly, it is\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                  8\\n\\f          ORDERED that that defendant\\u2019s Motion to Dismiss, Dkt. 17, is GRANTED in part\\n\\nunder Rule 12(b)(1) and in part under Rule 12(b)(6).

Then, in its Gatekeeper Clause, the provision\\nimplemented an injunction 2 prohibiting the Enjoined Parties from taking\\nspecific actions against the \\u201cProtected Parties,\\u201d stating:\\n        [N]o Enjoined Party may commence or pursue a claim or cause\\n        of action of any kind against any Protected Party that arose or\\n        arises from or is related to the Chapter 11 Case, the negotiation\\n        of the Plan, the administration of the Plan or property to be\\n        distributed under the Plan, the wind down of the business of\\n        the Debtor or Reorganized Debtor, the administration of the\\n        _____________________\\n        2\\n           Contrary to Highland Capital\\u2019s assertion, the Gatekeeper Clause is an\\ninjunction\\u2014a pre-filing injunction.

On direct appeal from the bankruptcy court\\nunder 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 158(d)(2), we \\u201creverse[d] only insofar as the plan\\nexculpates certain non-debtors in violation of 11 U.S.C. \\u00a7 524(e), str[uck]\\nthose few parties from the plan\\u2019s exculpation, and affirm[ed] on all remaining\\ngrounds.\\u201d Id. at 424.\\n       The investment fund parties then requested panel rehearing, asking\\nus to clarify whether our directive to strike certain persons and entities from\\nthe definition of the term \\u201cExculpated Party\\u201d used in the Exculpation\\nProvision also required striking the same persons and entities from the\\ndefinition of the term \\u201cProtected Parties\\u201d used in the Injunction Provision\\u2019s\\nGatekeeper Clause. We granted panel rehearing and made one substantive\\nchange to the opinion: deleting the sentence, \\u201cThe injunction and gatekeeper\\nprovisions are, on the other hand, perfectly lawful,\\u201d and replacing it with the\\nsentence, \\u201cWe now turn to the Plan\\u2019s injunction and gatekeeper\\nprovisions.\\u201d Id. at 438.\\n       Highland Capital then filed a Motion to Conform Plan, requesting that\\nthe bankruptcy court conform the Plan to our opinion in Highland I by, inter\\nalia, narrowing the definition of the term \\u201cExculpated Parties\\u201d to \\u201c(i) the\\nDebtor, (ii) the Independent Directors, (iii) the Committee, and (iv) the\\nmembers of the Committee (in their official capacities).\\u201d Because the\\nmotion did not propose any change to the definition of \\u201cProtected Parties\\u201d\\nused in the Gatekeeper Clause, as Appellants believed that it should in light\\nof Highland I, Appellants filed a limited objection to the motion. In the\\nobjection, Appellants contended:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        6\\n\\f Case: 23-10534          Document: 68-1         Page: 7       Date Filed: 03/18/2025\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                      No. 23-10534\\n\\n\\n        [A]mending the Plan only with respect to the definition of\\n        \\u201cExculpated Parties\\u201d does not comport with the Fifth\\n        Circuit\\u2019s holding [in Highland I] because the Plan must also be\\n        changed with respect to its injunction and gatekeeper\\n        provisions in order to conform to the Final Opinion. As the\\n        Funds\\u2019 Response explains, the Plan\\u2019s permanent injunction\\n        provisions exculpate all included in the defined term\\n        \\u201cProtected Party.\\u201d To conform with the Final Opinion, this\\n        definition too must change.\\n        The bankruptcy court held a hearing on the motion and Appellants\\u2019\\nobjection. At the conclusion of the hearing, the bankruptcy court granted\\nHighland\\u2019s motion as presented, without modifying the definition of\\n\\u201cProtected Parties.\\u201d The bankruptcy court then issued a written opinion in\\nsupport of its ruling, which confirmed its holding that Highland I required\\n\\u201cthat one change be made to the Plan to conform it to the mandate of the\\nFifth Circuit: revise the definition of \\u2018Exculpated Parties\\u2019 as proposed in the\\nMotion and no more.\\u201d\\n        Appellants petitioned for permission to appeal the Plan Conforming\\nOrder directly to this court, and we granted the petition. On appeal,\\nAppellants ask us to consider two issues: (1) whether the bankruptcy court\\nerred in failing to narrow the definition of \\u201cProtected Parties\\u201d used in the\\nGatekeeper Clause coextensively with its narrowing of the definition of\\n\\u201cExculpated Parties\\u201d used in the Exculpation Provision; and (2) whether the\\nGatekeeper Clause, even if so narrowed, is lawful considering bankruptcy\\ncourts\\u2019 limited jurisdiction. 3\\n\\n        _____________________\\n        3\\n          Appellants raised the latter issue in their opening brief. But they walked this\\nargument back at oral argument, averring that this appeal concerns only their first issue:\\nwhether Highland I should be read as narrowing the Gatekeeper Clause coextensively with\\nthe Exculpation Provision. Regardless, we decline to reach the second issue under our rule\\nof orderliness. See Mercado v. Lynch, 823 F.3d 276, 279 (5th Cir. 2016).

Notably, any\\nbankruptcy court action must square with the Bankruptcy Code\\u2019s edict that\\n\\u201cdischarge of a debt of the debtor does not affect the liability of any other\\nentity on . . . such debt.\\u201d 11 U.S.C. \\u00a7 524(e); see, e.g., In re Coho Res., Inc.,\\n345 F.3d 338, 342\\u201343 (5th Cir. 2003); Hall v.

Purdue Pharma L.P., 603 U.S. 204 (2024), that the Bankruptcy\\nCode \\u201cdoes not authorize a release and injunction that, as part of a plan of\\nreorganization under Chapter 11, effectively seeks to discharge claims against\\na nondebtor without the consent of the affected claimants.\\u201d Id. at 227. Even\\n\\n        _____________________\\n        4\\n           We note that courts and bankruptcy confirmation plans often use the terms\\n\\u201crelease,\\u201d \\u201cexculpation,\\u201d and \\u201cdischarge\\u201d loosely or interchangeably. Here, the Plan\\nuses the term \\u201cexculpation\\u201d to refer to absolution from liability for both debts and conduct\\nin the course of the bankruptcy. In this opinion, we mostly utilize the more generally used\\nterm \\u201crelease,\\u201d but we discuss and apply cases that use other terminology when their usage\\nis appropriate in the context of the discussion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                             9\\n\\fCase: 23-10534          Document: 68-1          Page: 10      Date Filed: 03/18/2025\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                      No. 23-10534\\n\\n\\nbefore Purdue Pharma, this court had held the same: that any provision that\\nnon-consensually releases non-debtors from liability for debts and/or\\nconduct, and any injunction that acts to shield non-debtors from such\\nliability, must be struck from a bankruptcy confirmation plan. See, e.g., In re\\nPac. Lumber Co., 584 F.3d 229, 252 (5th Cir. 2009) (Fifth Circuit case law\\n\\u201cseem[s] broadly to foreclose non-consensual non-debtor releases and\\npermanent injunctions.\\u201d); In re Vitro S.A.B. de C.V., 701 F.3d 1031, 1059,\\n1061\\u201362 (5th Cir. 2012); In re Zale Corp., 62 F.3d at 760 (\\u201c[W]e must\\noverturn a \\u00a7 105 injunction if it effectively discharges a nondebtor.\\u201d). 5\\n        As we explained in Pacific Lumber, \\u201c[t]he fresh start \\u00a7 524(e) provides\\nto debtors is not intended to serve th[e additional] purpose\\u201d of releasing non-\\ndebtors. 584 F.3d at 252\\u201353.

The\\nbankruptcy court may gatekeep such claims even after the bankruptcy\\nproceeding has concluded. See Villegas, 788 F.3d at 157, 159.\\n        We have articulated several rationales for allowing bankruptcy courts\\nto perform this limited gatekeeping function.                   For one, it prevents\\n\\u201cusurpation of the powers and duties which belong[] exclusively to [the\\nappointing bankruptcy] court [that] . . . would [make] impossible of\\nperformance the duty of that court to distribute the trust assets to creditors\\nequitably and according to their respective priorities.\\u201d Barton, 104 U.S. at\\n136; see Carroll, 788 F.3d at 506. In addition, \\u201cbecause a bankruptcy trustee\\nis considered an officer of his appointing court, the bankruptcy court \\u2018has a\\nstrong interest in protecting him from unjustified personal liability for acts\\ntaken within the scope of his official duties.\\u2019\\u201d Carroll, 788 F.3d at 506\\n(footnotes omitted) (quoting In re Lehal Realty Assocs., 101 F.3d 272, 276 (2d\\nCir. 1996)).\\n        Beyond these few abovenamed non-debtor individuals, we have never\\nextended the Barton doctrine to give bankruptcy courts gatekeeping power\\nover claims against non-debtors. See, e.g., Villegas, 788 F.3d at 159; Carroll,\\n788 F.3d at 505; In re Preferred Ready-Mix, LLC, 2024 WL 5252498, at *1\\n(5th Cir. Dec. 31, 2024); In re Foster, 2023 WL 20872, at *5 (5th Cir.

In this\\nsentence, we agreed with Appellants that the Gatekeeper Clause, as written\\nin the Plan, was too broad, but expressly stated that we were resolving this\\nproblem by narrowing the Gatekeeper Clause in coordination with our\\nnarrowing of the Exculpation Provision. Although we did not specify by\\nname the persons and entities to be stricken from the Gatekeeper Clause\\u2019s\\ndefinition of \\u201cProtected Parties,\\u201d it was implied that the same persons and\\nentities stricken from the Exculpation Provision\\u2019s definition of \\u201cExculpated\\nParties\\u201d were stricken also from the Gatekeeper Clause\\u2019s definition of\\n\\u201cProtected Parties.\\u201d For clarity, we state now in explicit terms that Highland\\nI struck all persons and entities from the definition of \\u201cProtected Parties\\u201d\\nexcept Highland Capital; the Independent Directors, for conduct within the\\nscope of their duties; the Committee; and the members of the Committee in\\ntheir official capacities, for conduct within the scope of their duties.\\n       In the next paragraph of Highland I, we considered the effect of the\\nInjunction Provision on only \\u201cthe legally exculpated parties.\\u201d Id. at 438.\\nThe use of this phrase further links our treatment of the Exculpation\\nProvision and the Injunction Provision and its Gatekeeper Clause. As just\\nstated above, striking certain persons and entities from the Exculpation\\nProvision had the effect of striking those same persons and entities from the\\nGatekeeper Clause, such that in the remainder of Highland I we needed to\\nconsider the effect of the Injunction Provision on only the \\u201clegally exculpated\\nparties\\u201d in the remainder of the opinion. Consequently, our conclusion in\\nPart IV(E)(2) that the injunction was \\u201cnot unlawfully overbroad or vague\\u201d\\ncommunicated our holding that the Injunction Provision was no longer\\noverbroad in the sense that it protected persons and entities that it could not\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       13\\n\\fCase: 23-10534       Document: 68-1        Page: 14    Date Filed: 03/18/2025\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  No. 23-10534\\n\\n\\nlegally protect, because we had already stricken those persons and entities\\nfrom the definition of \\u201cProtected Parties.\\u201d\\n       Second, our summary of Part IV(E) of the Highland I opinion indicates\\nthat we narrowed both provisions coextensively. The summary states:\\n       [T]he Plan violates \\u00a7 524(e) but only insofar as it exculpates\\n       and enjoins certain non-debtors. The exculpatory order is\\n       therefore vacated as to all parties except Highland Capital, the\\n       Committee and its members, and the Independent Directors\\n       for conduct within the scope of their duties. We otherwise\\n       affirm the inclusion of the injunction and the gatekeeper\\n       provisions in the Plan.\\nId. at 439 (first emphasis added). This is a crystal-clear statement of Highland\\nI\\u2019s holding that the Plan was unlawful in that it both released and enjoined\\nnon-debtors that could not lawfully be protected. And the fact that Highland\\nI states that we \\u201cotherwise affirm[ed] the inclusion of the injunction and\\ngatekeeper provisions,\\u201d id., shows that we made at least some alteration to\\nthe Injunction Provision and its Gatekeeper Clause. Given that no other\\nchanges to these provisions is evident from the face of Highland I, the only\\npossible change was the non-debtors from the Gatekeeper Clause\\u2019s definition\\nof \\u201cProtected Parties.\\u201d\\n                                       2\\n       The changes made to Highland I on rehearing only strengthen this\\nreading of the opinion.\\n       Preliminarily, the fact that the Highland I panel granted rehearing at\\nall shows that it intended to make changes to the Gatekeeper Clause. The\\npetition for limited panel rehearing asked the panel for one thing only: to\\n\\u201cconfirm that the scope of the injunction and gatekeeper provisions in the\\nPlan are limited in accordance with the Court\\u2019s holding on the exculpation\\nprovision.\\u201d Although the panel did not explicitly state its reasoning for\\n\\n\\n\\n                                      14\\n\\fCase: 23-10534           Document: 68-1           Page: 15      Date Filed: 03/18/2025\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       No. 23-10534\\n\\n\\ngranting rehearing, this court generally only grants rehearing when parties\\n\\u201cbring to [our] attention\\u201d specific issues in the original opinion. 5TH CIR.\\nR. 40.1.2. Consequently, the Highland I panel would not have granted\\nrehearing or made the change it did to the opinion for any purpose other than\\nto address the issue raised by Appellants in their petition for panel rehearing.\\n        Furthermore, on rehearing, the only change made to Highland I was\\nto walk back the most conspicuous statement that could have been construed\\nas saying that the Gatekeeper Clause should not be narrowed coextensively\\nwith the Exculpation Provision. At the beginning of Part IV(E)(2), the panel\\nstruck the sentence, \\u201cThe injunction and gatekeeper provisions are, on the\\nother hand, perfectly lawful,\\u201d In re Highland Cap. Mgmt., L.P., 2022 WL\\n3571094, at *13 (5th Cir. Aug. 19, 2022) (withdrawn opinion), and replaced\\nit with the sentence, \\u201cWe now turn to the Plan\\u2019s injunction and gatekeeper\\nprovisions,\\u201d Highland I, 48 F.4th at 438. In so doing, the panel took steps to\\nrectify any erroneous message that the Injunction Provision and its\\nGatekeeper Clause, as written in the Plan, were fully lawful. 7\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        _____________________\\n        7\\n           Highland Capital\\u2019s argument that narrowing the Gatekeeper Clause in this way\\nwill \\u201crender it largely meaningless\\u201d does not undermine the conclusion that the definition\\nof \\u201cProtected Parties\\u201d may not comprise more than the persons and entities to which we\\nnow clarify that it must be narrowed. It is indeed true, as Highland Capital points out, that\\n\\u201call the Exculpated Parties ceased to exist on the Effective Date of the Plan and have no\\nrole in any of the post-Effective Date activities,\\u201d such that limiting the Gatekeeper Clause\\nin this way means that the clause will \\u201cnot reach any conduct undertaken after the Effective\\nDate.\\u201d But as explained above, see supra Part III(A), the bankruptcy court lacks the power\\nto shield non-debtors from liability in this way. Furthermore, this will not gut the\\nGatekeeper Clause completely, as Highland Capital warns, because the clause will still\\nallow the bankruptcy court to gatekeep claims raised against the remaining persons and\\nentities related to their conduct during the bankruptcy proceedings.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                             15\\n\\fCase: 23-10534       Document: 68-1        Page: 16   Date Filed: 03/18/2025\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 No. 23-10534\\n\\n\\n                                     IV\\n       The clear weight of Supreme Court and Fifth Circuit precedent\\ndictates our holding: that a proper reading of Highland I requires that the\\ndefinition of \\u201cProtected Parties\\u201d used in the Plan\\u2019s Gatekeeper Clause be\\nnarrowed coextensively with the definition of \\u201cExculpated Parties\\u201d used in\\nthe Exculpation Provision.      Any other reading of Highland I would\\nimproperly grant the bankruptcy court authority to enforce what is perhaps\\nthe broadest gatekeeper injunction ever written into a bankruptcy\\nconfirmation plan. Such authority is patently beyond the power of an\\nArticle I court under \\u00a7 105.\\n       Accordingly, we REVERSE in part and REMAND for the district\\ncourt to revise the Plan\\u2019s definitions of both \\u201cExculpated Parties\\u201d and\\n\\u201cProtected Parties\\u201d to read simply: \\u201ccollectively, (i) the Debtor; (ii) the\\nIndependent Directors, for conduct within the scope of their duties; (iii) the\\nCommittee; and (iv) the members of the Committee in their official\\ncapacities, for conduct within the scope of their duties.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                      16\\n\\f\",\n",

In this\\nsentence, we agreed with Appellants that the Gatekeeper Clause, as written\\nin the Plan, was too broad, but expressly stated that we were resolving this\\nproblem by narrowing the Gatekeeper Clause in coordination with our\\nnarrowing of the Exculpation Provision. Although we did not specify by\\nname the persons and entities to be stricken from the Gatekeeper Clause\\u2019s\\ndefinition of \\u201cProtected Parties,\\u201d it was implied that the same persons and\\nentities stricken from the Exculpation Provision\\u2019s definition of \\u201cExculpated\\nParties\\u201d were stricken also from the Gatekeeper Clause\\u2019s definition of\\n\\u201cProtected Parties.\\u201d For clarity, we state now in explicit terms that Highland\\nI struck all persons and entities from the definition of \\u201cProtected Parties\\u201d\\nexcept Highland Capital; the Independent Directors, for conduct within the\\nscope of their duties; the Committee; and the members of the Committee in\\ntheir official capacities, for conduct within the scope of their duties.\\n       In the next paragraph of Highland I, we considered the effect of the\\nInjunction Provision on only \\u201cthe legally exculpated parties.\\u201d </pre><span class=\\\"citation no-link\\\">Id. at 438</span><pre class=\\\"inline\\\">.\\nThe use of this phrase further links our treatment of the Exculpation\\nProvision and the Injunction Provision and its Gatekeeper Clause. As just\\nstated above, striking certain persons and entities from the Exculpation\\nProvision had the effect of striking those same persons and entities from the\\nGatekeeper Clause, such that in the remainder of Highland I we needed to\\nconsider the effect of the Injunction Provision on only the \\u201clegally exculpated\\nparties\\u201d in the remainder of the opinion. Consequently, our conclusion in\\nPart IV(E)(2) that the injunction was \\u201cnot unlawfully overbroad or vague\\u201d\\ncommunicated our holding that the Injunction Provision was no longer\\noverbroad in the sense that it protected persons and entities that it could not\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       13\\n\\fCase: 23-10534       Document: 68-1        Page: 14    Date Filed: 03/18/2025\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                  No. 23-10534\\n\\n\\nlegally protect, because we had already stricken those persons and entities\\nfrom the definition of \\u201cProtected Parties.\\u201d\\n       Second, our summary of Part IV(E) of the Highland I opinion indicates\\nthat we narrowed both provisions coextensively. The summary states:\\n       [T]he Plan violates \\u00a7 524(e) but only insofar as it exculpates\\n       and enjoins certain non-debtors. The exculpatory order is\\n       therefore vacated as to all parties except Highland Capital, the\\n       Committee and its members, and the Independent Directors\\n       for conduct within the scope of their duties. We otherwise\\n       affirm the inclusion of the injunction and the gatekeeper\\n       provisions in the Plan.\\nId. at 439 (first emphasis added). This is a crystal-clear statement of Highland\\nI\\u2019s holding that the Plan was unlawful in that it both released and enjoined\\nnon-debtors that could not lawfully be protected. And the fact that Highland\\nI states that we \\u201cotherwise affirm[ed] the inclusion of the injunction and\\ngatekeeper provisions,\\u201d id., shows that we made at least some alteration to\\nthe Injunction Provision and its Gatekeeper Clause. Given that no other\\nchanges to these provisions is evident from the face of Highland I, the only\\npossible change was the non-debtors from the Gatekeeper Clause\\u2019s definition\\nof \\u201cProtected Parties.\\u201d\\n                                       2\\n       The changes made to Highland I on rehearing only strengthen this\\nreading of the opinion.\\n       Preliminarily, the fact that the Highland I panel granted rehearing at\\nall shows that it intended to make changes to the Gatekeeper Clause. The\\npetition for limited panel rehearing asked the panel for one thing only: to\\n\\u201cconfirm that the scope of the injunction and gatekeeper provisions in the\\nPlan are limited in accordance with the Court\\u2019s holding on the exculpation\\nprovision.\\u201d Although the panel did not explicitly state its reasoning for\\n\\n\\n\\n                                      14\\n\\fCase: 23-10534           Document: 68-1           Page: 15      Date Filed: 03/18/2025\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       No. 23-10534\\n\\n\\ngranting rehearing, this court generally only grants rehearing when parties\\n\\u201cbring to [our] attention\\u201d specific issues in the original opinion. 5TH CIR.\\nR. 40.1.2. Consequently, the Highland I panel would not have granted\\nrehearing or made the change it did to the opinion for any purpose other than\\nto address the issue raised by Appellants in their petition for panel rehearing.\\n        Furthermore, on rehearing, the only change made to Highland I was\\nto walk back the most conspicuous statement that could have been construed\\nas saying that the Gatekeeper Clause should not be narrowed coextensively\\nwith the Exculpation Provision.

In so doing, the panel took steps to\\nrectify any erroneous message that the Injunction Provision and its\\nGatekeeper Clause, as written in the Plan, were fully lawful. 7\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        _____________________\\n        7\\n           Highland Capital\\u2019s argument that narrowing the Gatekeeper Clause in this way\\nwill \\u201crender it largely meaningless\\u201d does not undermine the conclusion that the definition\\nof \\u201cProtected Parties\\u201d may not comprise more than the persons and entities to which we\\nnow clarify that it must be narrowed. It is indeed true, as Highland Capital points out, that\\n\\u201call the Exculpated Parties ceased to exist on the Effective Date of the Plan and have no\\nrole in any of the post-Effective Date activities,\\u201d such that limiting the Gatekeeper Clause\\nin this way means that the clause will \\u201cnot reach any conduct undertaken after the Effective\\nDate.\\u201d But as explained above, see supra Part III(A), the bankruptcy court lacks the power\\nto shield non-debtors from liability in this way. Furthermore, this will not gut the\\nGatekeeper Clause completely, as Highland Capital warns, because the clause will still\\nallow the bankruptcy court to gatekeep claims raised against the remaining persons and\\nentities related to their conduct during the bankruptcy proceedings.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                             15\\n\\fCase: 23-10534       Document: 68-1        Page: 16   Date Filed: 03/18/2025\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                 No. 23-10534\\n\\n\\n                                     IV\\n       The clear weight of Supreme Court and Fifth Circuit precedent\\ndictates our holding: that a proper reading of Highland I requires that the\\ndefinition of \\u201cProtected Parties\\u201d used in the Plan\\u2019s Gatekeeper Clause be\\nnarrowed coextensively with the definition of \\u201cExculpated Parties\\u201d used in\\nthe Exculpation Provision.

The Couches appeal the adverse judgment and also request that we\\nvacate and remand the district court\\u2019s attorneys\\u2019 fee award since the trial fees\\nwere not segregated by claim and conditional appellate fees were not proven.\\nBy failing to file any post-verdict motions, the Couches may have forfeited\\ntheir ability to seek appellate review as to the sufficiency of the evidence\\nsupporting the jury\\u2019s verdict. Even assuming such review is proper, there\\nwas evidence to support the jury\\u2019s verdict, so we affirm. Because the\\nCouches did not object to the lack of fee segregation and because Marrufo\\nwas not required to request or prove conditional appellate fees, we affirm the\\ntrial fee award and remand for an initial determination and award of appellate\\nfees.\\n                                       I\\n        Danny and Amber Couch entered into a contract for the sale of their\\nTexas auto mechanic\\u2019s shop to one of their employees, Hector Marrufo.\\nDanny Couch and his sister, Tiffany Farrar, who handled the business\\u2019s\\ntaxes, prepared a Loan Agreement to memorialize the terms of the\\ntransaction. The Couches loaned Marrufo the sale price of $432,000, and\\nMarrufo was required to make monthly payments on the loan until he had\\npaid it back in full, at which point the Couches would transfer legal title. The\\nagreement listed real property, the ongoing business, and tools and\\nequipment as security for the loan, all of which could be repossessed by the\\nCouches in the event of default. The agreement also specified that if any\\npayment was sixty days late, the property and business would revert back to\\nthe Couches. Marrufo made a down payment and every monthly $9,000\\ninstallment, totaling $449,622.\\n        The Loan Agreement also stated that Marrufo would \\u201cbe responsible\\nfor all debts associated with Danny\\u2019s Mobile Repair LLC.

For the two years after the\\ncontract was signed, while Marrufo was making payments, Couch and Farrar\\nrepeatedly assured Marrufo that all the bills were paid and current. In\\nNovember 2018, Couch informed Marrufo that there were delinquent federal\\ntaxes from the year 2016 \\u201cin the amount of [$]72 to $73,000\\u201d and said if\\nMarrufo \\u201ccould not pay them out-of-pocket, [Couch] was going to close [the\\nbusiness] down.\\u201d           Couch refused to show Marrufo the tax forms\\ncorroborating this claim, telling Marrufo that the forms were \\u201conly for\\n[Couch] to see,\\u201d then telling Marrufo to leave the shop. Couch changed the\\nlocks the next day.\\n       After the Couches refused to transfer title to the business, Marrufo\\nsued them for breach of contract and asserted several other state law claims.\\nAfter a jury trial, at which the Couches appeared pro se, the jury returned a\\nverdict that the Couches had breached the Loan Agreement and Marrufo had\\nnot. The jury awarded Marrufo $207,000 in damages for breach of contract,\\nand the court awarded attorneys\\u2019 fees of $134,611.58 and costs of $5,243.10.\\nThe Couches did not object to the jury instructions or charge, move for\\njudgment as a matter of law under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a) or\\n(b), or move for a new trial under Rule 59(a). 1 On appeal, the Couches\\nchallenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury\\u2019s verdict and\\nthe award of attorneys\\u2019 fees.\\n                                            II\\n       To begin, the Couches challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to\\nsupport the jury\\u2019s verdict.

First, they contend that Marrufo did not fulfill his\\nresponsibility to make monthly payments on the loan. According to the\\nCouches, the evidence showed that Marrufo made monthly payments on the\\nloan from the business account rather than from Marrufo\\u2019s personal account.\\nPer the Couches, such payments were simply their due as owners of the\\nbusiness and could not be considered payments towards the loan.\\n        However, evidence produced at trial supports that Marrufo, not the\\nCouches, owned the property and business.

Indeed, the Loan Agreement, which\\nwas introduced at trial, contained language confirming that the \\u201cproperty\\nand business will revert back to Danny and Amber Couch\\u201d should Marrufo\\ndefault on his payments. The jury was also entitled to rely upon Marrufo\\u2019s\\ntestimony that he did make the monthly payments. 5\\n        Next, the Couches argue that Marrufo breached the contract by failing\\nto pay all debts associated with the business. Specifically, they contend that\\nMarrufo\\u2019s failure to pay the Couches\\u2019 overdue taxes from 2016 breached the\\nagreement. Yet at trial, Danny Couch testified that he understood that he\\nwas responsible for the 2016 taxes, and Marrufo testified that he never\\nunderstood \\u201call debts\\u201d to include the Couches\\u2019 personal tax liability from\\n2016. Accordingly, there was evidence from which the jury could find that\\nMarrufo did not breach the Loan Agreement by not paying the 2016 taxes.\\nThe Couches also contend that the term \\u201call debts\\u201d in the Loan Agreement\\nnecessarily encompasses taxes. To the extent that this challenge goes beyond\\na sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge and raises a new legal argument, it is\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        5\\n           See Eastman Chem. Co. v.

The Couches appeal the adverse judgment and also request that we\\nvacate and remand the district court\\u2019s attorneys\\u2019 fee award since the trial fees\\nwere not segregated by claim and conditional appellate fees were not proven.\\nBy failing to file any post-verdict motions, the Couches may have forfeited\\ntheir ability to seek appellate review as to the sufficiency of the evidence\\nsupporting the jury\\u2019s verdict. Even assuming such review is proper, there\\nwas evidence to support the jury\\u2019s verdict, so we affirm. Because the\\nCouches did not object to the lack of fee segregation and because Marrufo\\nwas not required to request or prove conditional appellate fees, we affirm the\\ntrial fee award and remand for an initial determination and award of appellate\\nfees.\\n                                       I\\n        Danny and Amber Couch entered into a contract for the sale of their\\nTexas auto mechanic\\u2019s shop to one of their employees, Hector Marrufo.\\nDanny Couch and his sister, Tiffany Farrar, who handled the business\\u2019s\\ntaxes, prepared a Loan Agreement to memorialize the terms of the\\ntransaction. The Couches loaned Marrufo the sale price of $432,000, and\\nMarrufo was required to make monthly payments on the loan until he had\\npaid it back in full, at which point the Couches would transfer legal title. The\\nagreement listed real property, the ongoing business, and tools and\\nequipment as security for the loan, all of which could be repossessed by the\\nCouches in the event of default. The agreement also specified that if any\\npayment was sixty days late, the property and business would revert back to\\nthe Couches. Marrufo made a down payment and every monthly $9,000\\ninstallment, totaling $449,622.\\n        The Loan Agreement also stated that Marrufo would \\u201cbe responsible\\nfor all debts associated with Danny\\u2019s Mobile Repair LLC.

For the two years after the\\ncontract was signed, while Marrufo was making payments, Couch and Farrar\\nrepeatedly assured Marrufo that all the bills were paid and current. In\\nNovember 2018, Couch informed Marrufo that there were delinquent federal\\ntaxes from the year 2016 \\u201cin the amount of [$]72 to $73,000\\u201d and said if\\nMarrufo \\u201ccould not pay them out-of-pocket, [Couch] was going to close [the\\nbusiness] down.\\u201d           Couch refused to show Marrufo the tax forms\\ncorroborating this claim, telling Marrufo that the forms were \\u201conly for\\n[Couch] to see,\\u201d then telling Marrufo to leave the shop. Couch changed the\\nlocks the next day.\\n       After the Couches refused to transfer title to the business, Marrufo\\nsued them for breach of contract and asserted several other state law claims.\\nAfter a jury trial, at which the Couches appeared pro se, the jury returned a\\nverdict that the Couches had breached the Loan Agreement and Marrufo had\\nnot. The jury awarded Marrufo $207,000 in damages for breach of contract,\\nand the court awarded attorneys\\u2019 fees of $134,611.58 and costs of $5,243.10.\\nThe Couches did not object to the jury instructions or charge, move for\\njudgment as a matter of law under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a) or\\n(b), or move for a new trial under Rule 59(a). 1 On appeal, the Couches\\nchallenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury\\u2019s verdict and\\nthe award of attorneys\\u2019 fees.\\n                                            II\\n       To begin, the Couches challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to\\nsupport the jury\\u2019s verdict.

First, they contend that Marrufo did not fulfill his\\nresponsibility to make monthly payments on the loan. According to the\\nCouches, the evidence showed that Marrufo made monthly payments on the\\nloan from the business account rather than from Marrufo\\u2019s personal account.\\nPer the Couches, such payments were simply their due as owners of the\\nbusiness and could not be considered payments towards the loan.\\n        However, evidence produced at trial supports that Marrufo, not the\\nCouches, owned the property and business.

Indeed, the Loan Agreement, which\\nwas introduced at trial, contained language confirming that the \\u201cproperty\\nand business will revert back to Danny and Amber Couch\\u201d should Marrufo\\ndefault on his payments. The jury was also entitled to rely upon Marrufo\\u2019s\\ntestimony that he did make the monthly payments. 5\\n        Next, the Couches argue that Marrufo breached the contract by failing\\nto pay all debts associated with the business. Specifically, they contend that\\nMarrufo\\u2019s failure to pay the Couches\\u2019 overdue taxes from 2016 breached the\\nagreement. Yet at trial, Danny Couch testified that he understood that he\\nwas responsible for the 2016 taxes, and Marrufo testified that he never\\nunderstood \\u201call debts\\u201d to include the Couches\\u2019 personal tax liability from\\n2016. Accordingly, there was evidence from which the jury could find that\\nMarrufo did not breach the Loan Agreement by not paying the 2016 taxes.\\nThe Couches also contend that the term \\u201call debts\\u201d in the Loan Agreement\\nnecessarily encompasses taxes.

Trump focuses on \\u201cPrioritizing\\n\\nMilitary Excellence and Readiness.\\u201d 90 Fed. Reg. 8757 (Jan. 27, 2025). The military\\u2019s \\u201cclear\\n\\nmission\\u201d is to \\u201cprotect the American people and our homeland as the world\\u2019s most lethal and\\n\\neffective fighting force.\\u201d Id. \\u00a7 1. Service by transgender persons1 is \\u201cinconsistent\\u201d with this\\n\\nmission because they lack the \\u201crequisite warrior ethos\\u201d to achieve \\u201cmilitary excellence.\\u201d Id.\\n\\n\\u00a7\\u00a7 1, 2. On February 26, 2025, Secretary of Defense Peter B. Hegseth issued a policy to\\n\\nimplement EO14183\\u2019s directives. Dkt. 63-1 (Hegseth Policy). It disqualifies \\u201c[t]ransgender\\n\\ntroops . . . from service without an exemption.\\u201d2\\n\\n         The President has the power\\u2014indeed the obligation\\u2014to ensure military readiness. At\\n\\ntimes, however, leaders have used concern for military readiness to deny marginalized persons\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n EO14183 does not employ the word \\u201ctransgender.\\u201d But Defendants concede the term it does\\nuse\\u2014those with a gender identity that diverges from their biological sex\\u2014refers to transgender\\npersons. See Docket (Dkt.) 58, Transcript to Court Hearing (Tr.) (Feb. 18, 2025) at 44.\\n2\\n  The Hegseth Policy also studiously does not employ the word \\u201ctransgender,\\u201d but as issued it\\nbans transgender persons. Both the Department of Defense and Secretary Hegseth announced\\nthis inescapable fact via social media. @DODResponse, X (Feb. 27, 2025, 12:08 PM);\\n@SecDef, X (Feb. 27, 2025) (repost).\\n                                                 1\\n\\fthe privilege of serving. \\u201c[Fill in the blank] is not fully capable and will hinder combat\\n\\neffectiveness; [fill in the blank] will disrupt unit cohesion and so diminish military effectiveness;\\n\\nallowing [fill in the blank] to serve will undermine training, make it impossible to recruit\\n\\nsuccessfully, and disrupt military order.\\u201d3 First minorities, then women in combat, then gays\\n\\nfilled in that blank. Today, however, our military is stronger and our Nation is safer for the\\n\\nmillions of such blanks (and all other persons) who serve.4\\n\\n       Currently before the Court is Plaintiffs\\u2019 Renewed Application for Preliminary Injunction.\\n\\nDkt. 72 (App.). Plaintiffs, who are transgender, claim that EO14183 and the Hegseth Policy\\n\\n(together, the Military Ban) treats them as today\\u2019s \\u201cfill in the blank\\u201d group. Seeking nothing\\n\\nmore than to serve their country, they ask the Court to enjoin the Military Ban. App. at 26. They\\n\\nclaim that the Hegseth Policy was rushed and reached a preordained result, contains no analysis,\\n\\nand has an exemption in name only. Id. at 56. The Ban at bottom invokes derogatory language\\n\\nto target a vulnerable group in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Id. at 29, 35\\u201337; see U.S.\\n\\nConst. amend. V.\\n\\n       Not at all, say Defendants. They assert that the Military Ban is necessary because\\n\\ntransgender persons undermine \\u201cmilitary readiness\\u201d and disrupt \\u201c[u]nit cohesion, good order,\\n\\nand discipline.\\u201d Dkt. 81 (Opp.) at 40\\u201354.

They have served in roles ranging from Senior Military Science Instructor to\\n\\nArtillery Platoon Commander to Intelligence Analyst to Satellite Operator to Operations\\n\\nResearch Analyst to Naval Flight Officer to Weapons Officer. They have deployed around the\\n\\nglobe, from Afghanistan to Poland to Korea to Iraq to Kuwait to the USS Ronald Reagan and\\n\\nUSS George W. Bush. One is presently deployed to an active combat zone. They have earned\\n\\nmore than 80 commendations including: a Bronze Star; two Global War on Terrorism Service\\n\\nMedals; two Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medals; numerous Meritorious Service\\n\\nMedals; numerous Commendation Medals; Air and Space Outstanding Unit Awards; and the\\n\\nMilitary Outstanding Volunteer Service Medal, among many others.\\n\\n       Defendants rejoin that these service records are inapposite. The Court must ignore them\\n\\nand instead \\u201cdefer to the military\\u2019s judgment.\\u201d Tr. (Mar. 12, 2025) at 180. Yes, the Court must\\n\\ndefer. But not blindly. The President issued EO14183 within seven days of taking office, and\\n\\nSecretary Hegseth issued the Policy thirty days later. There is no evidence that they consulted\\n\\nwith uniformed military leaders before doing so. Neither document contains any analysis nor\\n\\ncites any data. They pronounce that transgender persons are not honorable, truthful, or\\n\\ndisciplined\\u2014but Defense counsel concedes that these assertions are pure conjecture.\\n\\n              THE COURT: Is saying that transgender people or people with\\n              gender dysphoria, [that] their inherent identity is inconsistent with a\\n              commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, is\\n              that demeaning to them?\\n              DEFENSE COUNSEL: I don\\u2019t have a characterization for that,\\n              Your Honor.\\n\\n                                                 3\\n\\f              THE COURT: Okay. And if I asked you about all the other words\\n              in [the Military Ban], with respect to the characterization of\\n              transgender people or people with gender dysphoria, you would\\n              have the same answer?\\n              DEFENSE COUNSEL: Yes, Your Honor.\\n              THE COURT: There\\u2019s nothing [supporting these assertions] in the\\n              studies; right?\\n              DEFENSE COUNSEL: That says those same things, no, Your\\n              Honor, not that I know of.\\n              THE COURT: [No study] says anything close to those things;\\n              correct?\\n              DEFENSE COUNSEL: Not that I know of, Your Honor.\\n\\nTr. (Mar. 12, 2025) at 188\\u201389. An \\u201cAction Memo\\u201d claims the Policy \\u201cwas informed through\\n\\nconsideration of\\u201d three studies and cost data. Dkt. 73-23 (Action Memo) at 4. Who considered\\n\\nthe information, however, is anyone\\u2019s guess; Defendants do not know. Maybe no one, because\\n\\none study is eight years old and the other two support Plaintiffs\\u2019 position.\\n\\n       Transgender persons have served openly since 2021, but Defendants have not analyzed\\n\\ntheir service. That is unfortunate. Plaintiffs\\u2019 service records alone are Exhibit A for the\\n\\nproposition that transgender persons can have the warrior ethos, physical and mental health,\\n\\nselflessness, honor, integrity, and discipline to ensure military excellence. Defendants agree.\\n\\nThey agree that Plaintiffs are mentally and physically fit to serve, have \\u201cserved honorably,\\u201d and\\n\\n\\u201chave satisfied the rigorous standards\\u201d demanded of them. Tr. (Feb. 18, 2025) at 9\\u201314, 148; see\\n\\nalso Tr. (Mar. 12, 2025) at 130. Plaintiffs, they acknowledge, have \\u201cmade America safer.\\u201d Tr.\\n\\n(Feb. 18, 2025) at 10. So why discharge them and other decorated soldiers? Crickets from\\n\\nDefendants on this key question.\\n\\n       Plaintiffs have also introduced declarations from the military leaders responsible for\\n\\nintegrating transgender persons into open military service. Each declarant attests that our\\n\\nmilitary has not fallen into an \\u201cexistential\\u201d crisis since transgender persons began serving openly\\n\\n                                                 4\\n\\fin 2021. Nor have our \\u201clethal and effective\\u201d soldiers come unglued when asked to use preferred\\n\\npronouns, which the Hegseth Policy also bans. To the contrary, they each testify that recruiting,\\n\\nunit cohesion, and military readiness have improved since 2021.\\n\\n       To obtain an injunction, Plaintiffs must establish a likelihood of success on the merits.\\n\\nThey have done so. The Court\\u2019s factual findings, the vast majority conceded by Defendants and\\n\\nall supported by the Record, make it highly unlikely that the Military Ban will survive judicial\\n\\nreview, whether it be rational basis or intermediate scrutiny. Plaintiffs must also show\\n\\nirreparable harm and that the balance of the equities and the public interest favor an injunction.\\n\\nOn the former, Plaintiffs face a violation of their constitutional rights, which constitutes\\n\\nirreparable harm. Indeed, the cruel irony is that thousands of transgender servicemembers have\\n\\nsacrificed\\u2014some risking their lives\\u2014to ensure for others the very equal protection rights the\\n\\nMilitary Ban seeks to deny them. On the latter, Defendants have not shown they will be\\n\\nburdened by continuing the status quo pending this litigation, and avoiding constitutional\\n\\nviolations is always in the public interest.\\n\\n       The Court therefore GRANTS Plaintiffs\\u2019 Renewed Application for Preliminary\\n\\nInjunction. Dkt. 72. The Court details the scope of the injunction in the Order that accompanies\\n\\nthis Opinion. The Court, on its own motion, stays its Order until March 21, 2025, at 10:00 am\\n\\neastern, to provide Defendants time to consider filing an emergency stay with the D.C. Circuit.\\n\\n                                               *****\\n\\n       The Court does not issue this preliminary injunction lightly. Judicial overreach is no less\\n\\npernicious than executive overreach. But the coordinate branches must, \\u201cby their mutual\\n\\nrelations, be the means of keeping each other in their proper places.\\u201d The Federalist No. 51\\n\\n(James Madison). The President and Defendants could have crafted a policy that balances the\\n\\n\\n                                                  5\\n\\fNation\\u2019s need for a prepared military and Americans\\u2019 right to equal protection. They still can.\\n\\nThe Military Ban, however, is not that policy. The Court therefore must act to uphold the equal\\n\\nprotection rights that the military defends every day.\\n\\n       The Court\\u2019s opinion is long, but its premise is simple. In the self-evident truth that \\u201call\\n\\npeople are created equal,\\u201d5 all means all. Nothing more. And certainly nothing less.\\n\\n                                        BACKGROUND\\n      I.

President Trump Orders a Ban on Transgender Service\\n\\n       On August 25, 2017, President Trump issued a memorandum entitled \\u201cPresidential\\n\\nMemorandum for the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security\\u201d (2017\\n\\nMemorandum). Doe 1, 275 F. Supp. 3d at 183.

Id. at 183\\u201384. It\\n\\ninstructed Secretary Mattis to gather a working group to review the 2017 Memorandum and\\n\\nadvise if the group disagreed with the Memorandum\\u2019s conclusions. Id. at 185.\\n\\n           B.      Courts Enjoin the 2017 Memorandum\\n\\n       Litigation ensued. Several transgender persons then serving or hoping to enlist\\n\\nchallenged President Trump\\u2019s 2017 Memorandum. Id. at 175\\u201376. On October 30, 2017, Judge\\n\\nColleen Kollar-Kotelly of this Court entered a preliminary injunction, effectively barring any\\n\\nchange from the status quo as it related to service and accession. See id. at 177. She dismissed\\n\\nthe claims relating to gender affirming care based on a lack of standing. Id. The D.C. Circuit\\n\\ndeclined to stay the injunction pending appeal. Doe 1 v.

Supp. 3d 747 (D. Md. 2017);\\n\\nKarnoski v. Trump, 2017 WL 6311305 (W.D. Wash. Dec. 11, 2017); Stockman v. Trump, 2017\\n\\nWL 9732572 (C.D.

DoD Recommends Revisions to the 2017 Memorandum\\n\\n       DoD subsequently issued a report that addressed transgender military service. Dkt. 73-8\\n\\n(2018 Report) at 5\\u201349. The report concluded that transgender persons undermine military\\n\\npreparedness. See id. at 37\\u201338. It likened gender dysphoria to \\u201cbipolar disorder, personality\\n\\ndisorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, suicidal behavior, and even body dysmorphic disorder.\\u201d\\n\\nId. at 25. It claimed that individuals with gender dysphoria were more likely to have substance\\n\\nabuse issues and commit suicide and that they would inflict excessive costs on the military. Id.\\n\\nat 26, 46. It emphasized that the \\u201cuncertainty\\u201d surrounding the view of medical professionals\\n\\nmeant that the military should \\u201cproceed with caution.\\u201d Id. at 11.\\n\\n       Based on this report, on February 22, 2018, Secretary Mattis presented a memorandum\\n\\n(Mattis Policy) to President Trump that proposed an alternative to the enjoined 2017\\n\\nMemorandum. See generally id. at 2\\u20134. The Mattis Policy would not have banned service to all\\n\\ntransgender persons. Id. at 3. Instead, it recommended banning anyone who had undergone\\n\\ngender transition and those with a history or current diagnosis of gender dysphoria, except in\\n\\nsome limited circumstances. Id. It allowed transgender persons already in the military\\u2014who\\n\\ndid not have gender dysphoria and were otherwise qualified for service\\u2014to serve, but only in\\n\\ntheir biological sex. Id. at 3\\u20134.\\n\\n       President Trump issued a memorandum on March 23, 2018, revoking the 2017\\n\\nMemorandum and delegating authority to DoD and Department of Homeland Security to\\n\\nimplement the Mattis Policy. Third Amend. Compl. \\u00b6 256.\\n\\n           D.       The Mattis Policy Takes Effect\\n\\n       Following publication of the Mattis Policy, the Doe 1 plaintiffs amended their complaint.\\n\\nAgain, the government moved to dismiss and asked the court to dissolve the existing preliminary\\n\\n\\n                                                9\\n\\finjunction. Doe 2 v. Trump, 315 F. Supp. 3d 474, 479 (D.D.C. 2018). The district court declined\\n\\nto do so. Id. at 480. The government again appealed\\u2014this time successfully. Doe 2 v.\\n\\nShanahan, 755 F. App\\u2019x 19, 22 (D.C. Cir. 2019). In an unpublished opinion on January 4, 2019,\\n\\nthe D.C. Circuit reversed the district court\\u2019s denial of the government\\u2019s motion to dissolve the\\n\\npreliminary injunction and vacated the preliminary injunction without prejudice.8 Id. The D.C.\\n\\nCircuit held that \\u201c[i]t was clear error [for the district court] to say there was no significant\\n\\nchange\\u201d in military policy\\u2014from the genesis of the 2017 Memorandum to the issuance of the\\n\\nMattis Policy\\u2014and so vacatur of the preliminary injunction was warranted. Id. at 23.\\n\\n        The Mattis Policy went into effect after the dissolution of the preliminary injunction. It\\n\\nremained in place until the beginning of the Biden administration in 2021. App. at 14.\\n\\n    III.    BIDEN\\u2014TRANSGENDER PERSONS CAN SERVE\\n\\n        On January 25, 2021, President Joseph R.

The Order revokes President Biden\\u2019s Executive\\n\\nOrder 14004, which allowed transgender persons to serve openly in the military. Id. \\u00a7 5. It\\n\\ndescribes the U.S. military\\u2019s mission as \\u201cprotect[ing] the American people and our homeland as\\n\\nthe world\\u2019s most lethal and effective fighting force.\\u201d Id. \\u00a7 1. But it adds that \\u201cthe Armed Forces\\n\\nhave been afflicted with radical gender ideology to appease activists unconcerned with the\\n\\nrequirements of military service.\\u201d Id. It claims that \\u201cadoption of a gender identity inconsistent\\n\\nwith an individual\\u2019s sex conflicts with a soldier\\u2019s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and\\n\\ndisciplined lifestyle, even in one\\u2019s personal life. A man\\u2019s assertion that he is a woman, and his\\n\\nrequirement that others honor this falsehood, is not consistent with the humility and selflessness\\n\\nrequired of a service member.\\u201d Id.\\n\\n        EO14183 declares that it is U.S. Government policy \\u201cto establish high standards for troop\\n\\nreadiness, lethality, cohesion, honesty, humility, uniformity, and integrity.\\u201d Id. \\u00a7 2. \\u201cThis policy\\n\\nis inconsistent with the medical, surgical, and mental health constraints on individuals with\\n\\ngender dysphoria\\u201d and \\u201cwith shifting pronoun usage or use of pronouns that inaccurately reflect\\n\\nan individual\\u2019s sex.\\u201d Id.

Id. \\u00b6\\u00b6 36, 46, 56, 69, 80, 108, 135, 147, 155, 162. The Government concedes that\\n\\neach active-duty Plaintiff is honorable, truthful, and disciplined, and that each is currently\\n\\nphysically and mentally fit to serve. Tr. (Feb. 18, 2025) at 9. They have \\u201cserved honorably\\u201d and\\n\\n\\u201chave satisfied the rigorous standards\\u201d of military service. Id. at 9, 14, 148. The Government\\n\\nalso concedes that, together, Plaintiffs have made America safer. Id. at 10. The active-duty\\n\\nPlaintiffs have adhered to all military standards and serve without accommodation. See, e.g.,\\n\\nDkt. 72-27 (Herrero Second Supp. Decl.)

Plaintiffs sue the individual\\n\\nDefendants in their official capacities. Id. \\u00b6 217.\\n\\n       Plaintiffs allege that the Military Ban, \\u201c[r]ather than being based on any legitimate\\n\\ngovernmental purpose, . . . reflects animosity toward transgender people because of their\\n\\ntransgender status.\\u201d Id. \\u00b6 314. They claim that the Military Ban violates the equal protection\\n\\ncomponent of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Id. \\u00b6\\u00b6 317\\u201331. They also allege\\n\\nthat the Military Ban violates the currently serving Plaintiffs\\u2019 procedural due process rights\\n\\n\\n\\n11\\n  Upon agreement of the parties, the Court dismissed President Trump as a defendant on\\nFebruary 13, 2025.

Tr. (Feb. 13, 2025).\\n\\nOn February 15, 2025, the Government confirmed that it would neither present any affirmative\\n\\nwitnesses nor cross-examine any of Plaintiffs\\u2019 declarants at the preliminary injunction hearing.13\\n\\nAt that point, Plaintiffs notified all parties that it would not call on any of its declarants.14 The\\n\\nCourt held oral argument on February 18 and 19, 2025. At the February 18 hearing, the Court\\n\\ngranted the Government\\u2019s request that it refrain from ruling until after DoD released its\\n\\nimplementing policies. Tr. (Feb. 18, 2025) at 113\\u201314. On March 4, 2025, Plaintiffs filed their\\n\\nThird Amended Complaint. Dkt. 69. They filed a Renewed Application for Preliminary\\n\\nInjunction on March 7, 2025. Dkt. 72. Defendants filed their Opposition to Plaintiffs\\u2019\\n\\nApplication on March 11, 2025. Dkt. 81. The Court heard oral argument on the renewed\\n\\nApplication on March 12, 2025.\\n\\n\\n\\n12\\n  Since Plaintiffs have established likelihood of success on their equal protection claim, the\\nCourt does not address the procedural due process or estoppel claims.\\n13\\n     Email from Defs.\\u2019 Counsel to Court and Pls.\\u2019 Counsel (Feb. 15, 2025).\\n14\\n     Email from Pls.\\u2019 Counsel to Court and Defs.\\u2019 Counsel (Feb. 15, 2025).\\n                                                  16\\n\\f           C.

Secretary Hegseth issued the Policy \\u201cpursuant to Executive Order 14183, \\u2018Prioritizing\\n\\nMilitary Excellence and Readiness.\\u2019\\u201d Id. at 1. The Policy states that \\u201c[m]ilitary service by\\n\\nService members and applicants for military service who have a current diagnosis or history of,\\n\\nor exhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria is incompatible with military service.\\u201d\\n\\nId. at 3. Consequently, \\u201c[i]ndividuals who have a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit\\n\\nsymptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria are no longer eligible for military service.\\u201d Id.\\n\\n       The Hegseth Policy directs the Secretaries of the Military Departments to \\u201c[e]stablish\\n\\nprocedures and implement steps to identify Service members who have a current diagnosis or\\n\\nhistory of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria within 30 days of this\\n\\nmemorandum.\\u201d Id. at 5. Next, \\u201c[w]ithin 30 days of identification,\\u201d the Departments must\\n\\n\\u201cbegin separation actions . . . for Service members who have a current diagnosis or history of, or\\n\\nexhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria and are not granted a waiver.\\u201d Id.\\n\\nRegarding retention policies, \\u201c[s]ervice members who have a current diagnosis or history of, or\\n\\nexhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria are disqualified from military service.\\u201d Id.\\n\\nat 8. In addition, \\u201c[s]ervice members who have a history of cross-sex hormone therapy or a\\n\\nhistory of sex reassignment or genital reconstruction surgery as treatment for gender dysphoria\\n\\nor in pursuit of a sex transition, are disqualified from military service.\\u201d Id.\\n\\n       The Hegseth Policy purports to allow exemptions \\u201con a case-by-case basis, provided\\n\\nthere is a compelling Government interest in retaining the Service member that directly supports\\n\\nwarfighting capabilities\\u201d and the servicemember meets the following three conditions: he or she\\n\\n\\n                                                  17\\n\\f(1) \\u201cdemonstrates 36 consecutive months of stability in [his or her] [birth] sex without clinically\\n\\nsignificant distress or impairment,\\u201d (2) \\u201cdemonstrates that he or she has never attempted to\\n\\ntransition to any sex other than their [birth] sex,\\u201d and (3) \\u201cis willing and able to adhere to all\\n\\napplicable standards, including the standards associated with the Service member\\u2019s [birth] sex.\\u201d\\n\\nId. Any transgender person who cannot satisfy these conditions is disqualified from service.\\n\\n       With respect to separation policies, the Hegseth Policy provides that \\u201c[s]ervice members\\n\\nwho have a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with, gender\\n\\ndysphoria may elect to separate voluntarily in the 30 days following signature of this guidance.\\u201d\\n\\nId. at 9. Those who do so \\u201cmay be eligible for voluntary separation pay in accordance with 10\\n\\nU.S.C. \\u00a7 1175a and DoDI 1332.43 . . . at a rate that is twice the amount the Service member\\n\\nwould have been eligible for involuntary separation pay, in accordance with DoDI 1332.29.\\u201d Id.\\n\\nThe Policy provides that those \\u201cchoosing voluntary separation will not have to repay any\\n\\nbonuses received prior to the date of this memorandum, even if they have a remaining service\\n\\nobligation, pursuant to 37 U.S.C. \\u00a7 373(b)(l).\\u201d Id. On the other hand, \\u201c[t]he Military\\n\\nDepartments may recoup any bonuses received prior to the date of this memorandum for Service\\n\\nmembers choosing to be involuntarily separated.\\u201d Id.\\n\\n       On the same day that DoD issued the Hegseth Policy, the Under Secretary of Defense for\\n\\nPersonnel and Readiness also distributed \\u201cImplementing Guidance for Prioritizing Military\\n\\nExcellence and Readiness Executive Order,\\u201d also called the Action Memo. Dkt. 73-23 (Action\\n\\nMemo). The Action Memo repeats the purposes and policies President Trump outlined in\\n\\nEO14183 and reiterates the main points of the Hegseth Policy. Id. It lists four\\n\\n\\u201cconsideration[s]\\u201d that \\u201cinformed\\u201d the Hegseth Policy: (1) the Mattis Policy, (2) a 2021 review\\n\\nconducted by DoD\\u2019s Psychological Health Center of Excellence and the Accession Medical\\n\\n\\n                                                  18\\n\\fStandards Analysis and Research Activity, (3) a 2025 medical literature review conducted by the\\n\\nOffice of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, and (4) a review of cost data. Id.\\n\\nat 4\\u20135.\\n\\n          Based on these reviews, DoD concluded that \\u201c[w]hile Service members with gender\\n\\ndysphoria volunteered to serve their country, the costs associated with their health care, coupled\\n\\nwith the medical and readiness risks associated with their diagnosis and associated treatment that\\n\\ncan limit their deployability, make continued service by such individuals incompatible with the\\n\\nDepartment\\u2019s rigorous standards and national security imperative to deliver a ready, deployable\\n\\nforce.\\u201d Id. at 5.\\n\\n                                       FINDINGS OF FACT\\n\\n          \\u201cA preliminary injunction may be granted based on less formal procedures and on less\\n\\nextensive evidence than in a trial on the merits.\\u201d Cobell v. Norton, 391 F.3d 251, 261 (D.C. Cir.\\n\\n2004). Courts, for example, permit hearsay evidence in the form of sworn affidavits in\\n\\nconsidering an application for preliminary injunction. See e.g., Karem v. Trump, 404 F. Supp. 3d\\n\\n203 (D.D.C. 2019) (citing Mullins v. City of New York, 626 F.3d 47, 52 (2d Cir. 2010)\\n\\n(collecting cases from six other circuits)).\\n\\n          The Court makes its factual findings based on the entire record, including the Third\\n\\nAmended Complaint, documents cited in the Complaint, exhibits to the preliminary injunction\\n\\napplication and opposition, the declarations the parties submitted, and concessions15 or points of\\n\\nagreement made by the parties at oral argument (altogether, the Record). See American Foreign\\n\\nService Ass\\u2019n, et al. v. Trump et al., 2025 WL 573762, at *1 (D.D.C. Feb. 21, 2025). It is early\\n\\n\\n15\\n  Over three hearings on Plaintiffs\\u2019 motion, Defendants made numerous concessions concerning\\nthe scope and application of EO14183 and the Hegseth Policy. When citing a concession, the\\nCourt cites \\u201cDefs. Concession\\u201d and then the transcript cite.\\n\\n                                                  19\\n\\fdays for this litigation, however. Things change. If new developments cause Defendants to\\n\\nmove to dissolve this injunction, the Court will hear that motion expeditiously.\\n\\n       I.       THE HEGSETH POLICY BANS ALL TRANSGENDER TROOPS\\n\\n       Secretary Hegseth issued the Hegseth Policy on February 26, 2025. Dkt. 63-1. The next\\n\\nday, the Department of Defense and Secretary Hegseth publicly announced that under it:\\n\\n\\u201cTransgender troops are disqualified from service without an exemption.\\u201d16 Defense counsel\\n\\ncontends that the Court must ignore Secretary Hegseth\\u2019s public description of the policy he\\n\\nwrote and that he is responsible for implementing. Tr. (Mar. 12, 2025) at 19\\u201322. Secretary\\n\\nHegseth used the word \\u201ctransgender,\\u201d defense counsel claims, only as \\u201cshorthand\\u201d for gender\\n\\ndysphoria. Id. at 22. Seriously? These were not off-the-cuff remarks at a cocktail party. DoD\\n\\nand Secretary Hegseth used official government accounts to announce a new policy affecting the\\n\\nentire U.S. Military. The Court presumes that in doing so they did not use loose or misleading\\n\\nlanguage. Indeed, if the Hegseth Policy addressed only gender dysphoria, the post would have\\n\\nread, \\u201cGender dysphoria is a disqualifying medical condition for service.\\u201d Both sentences\\n\\ncontain nine words, belying counsel\\u2019s \\u201cshorthand\\u201d excuse.\\n\\n       DoD and Secretary Hegseth announced that the Policy bans \\u201ctransgender troops\\u201d because\\n\\nthat is precisely what it does. To be sure, the word transgender does not appear on its pages. It\\n\\nis nonetheless aimed squarely at transgender persons, banning everyone:\\n\\n            \\u2022   with a current diagnosis of gender dysphoria;\\n            \\u2022   with a history of gender dysphoria;\\n            \\u2022   who exhibits symptoms consistent with gender dysphoria;\\n            \\u2022   with a history of cross-sex hormone therapy (as treatment for gender dysphoria or\\n                in pursuit of sex transition);\\n\\n\\n16\\n  @DODResponse, X (Feb. 27, 2025, 12:08 PM); @SecDef, X (Feb. 27, 2025).

The Action Memo, an internal document\\n\\naccompanying the Hegseth Policy, explains that the Military Ban \\u201cwas informed through\\n\\nconsideration of, among other things,\\u201d EO14183, the Hegseth Policy, and the following: (1) the\\n\\n\\u201cSecDef Memorandum\\u201d from February 22, 2018 (i.e., the Mattis Policy); (2) \\u201ca 2021 review\\n\\nconducted by . . . the Accession Medical Standards Analysis and Research Activity,\\u201d (AMSARA\\n\\nReport), (3) \\u201c[a] 2025 medical literature review,\\u201d (Medical Literature Review), and (4) \\u201ca review\\n\\nof cost data.\\u201d Action Memo at 4\\u20135.\\n\\n       After listing the sources the Military Ban relies on, the Action Memo concludes that\\n\\n                [w]hile Service members with gender dysphoria volunteered to\\n                serve their country, the costs associated with their health care,\\n                coupled with the medical and readiness risks associated with their\\n                diagnosis and associated treatment that can limit their\\n                deployability, make continued service by such individuals\\n                incompatible with the Department\\u2019s rigorous standards and\\n                national security imperative to deliver a ready, deployable force.\\n\\n\\n18\\n  Mr. Skelly claims that the Hegseth Policy is \\u201cboth punitive and based on animus.\\u201d Dkt. 72-73\\n\\u00b6 3.

Dkt. 73-24. The Center studied medical\\n\\nissues relating to accession of persons with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria. The\\n\\nCenter compared the available accessions records of transgender service persons to a cohort of\\n\\nother servicemembers. Id. at 5.\\n\\n       The Action Memo\\u2019s entire discussion of the AMSARA Report is:\\n\\n               A 2021 review conducted by DoD\\u2019s [AMSARA team] found that \\u201crates of\\n               disability evaluation were estimated to be higher [about 12%] among\\n               [transgender] service members [1%]. Additionally, this review found that\\n               nearly 40% of Service members with gender dysphoria in an observed\\n               cohort were non-deployable over a 24 month period. This level of non-\\n               deployability creates significant readiness risk and places additional\\n               burdens on Service members without gender dysphoria to meet\\n               requirements.\\n\\nAction Memo at 4 (emphasis added).\\n\\n       No one who has read the AMSARA Report could find that it supports this conclusion.\\n\\nTo start, the Action Memo fails to mention the Report\\u2019s key finding: rates of transgender persons\\n\\nexperiencing the conditions of the cohort group (psychiatric, musculoskeletal, and neurological)\\n\\n\\u201cwere comparable to those of all service members evaluated for disability.\\u201d Dkt. 73-24 at 6\\n\\n                                                25\\n\\f(emphasis added). The other rates the Center studied were \\u201csimilar\\u201d between the transgender\\n\\ncohort and the other servicemember cohort as to: (1) the proportion with history of any accession\\n\\nmedical disqualification status; (2) the distribution of specific medical disqualifications; (3) the\\n\\nrates of adverse attrition; and (4) the rates of existing prior to service discharge. Id. at 4. The\\n\\nAction Memo quotes the only rate that was higher for transgender persons, and that was a rate of\\n\\nevaluation, not occurrence. Action Memo at 4.\\n\\n       With respect to non-deployability, the Action Memo also ignores that \\u201cdata w[as] not\\n\\navailable from non-transgender service members that could serve as a basis for comparison to\\n\\nindicate if supposed non-deployability rates amongst the transgender cohorts differed from the\\n\\noverall non-deployability rate.\\u201d Dkt. 86-1 (AMSARA Parts I-III) at 11\\u201312. Without comparator\\n\\ndata, the non-deployability rate for the transgender cohort is not informative, something the\\n\\nReport highlights. Dkt. 73-24 at 6.\\n\\n       The Center also conducted a medical literature review as part of its work that the Action\\n\\nMemo ignores altogether. One study stands out. The AMSARA Report cited, without criticism,\\n\\na 2014 study that summarized \\u201cand challenge[d] [] common notions to justify barring\\n\\ntransgender individuals from Service which are actually not supported by research and not\\n\\ninternally consistent with other DoD policies.\\u201d Dkt. 86-1 at 2. \\u201cThe most notable challenge to\\n\\nthese assumptions is falsely equating transgender identify with mental health disorders, which\\n\\nhas become a debunked connection broadly in the field.\\u201d Id.\\n\\n       The Court does not question military judgment broadly as to acceptable non-deployment\\n\\nrates. The Court instead finds that the Action Memo\\u2019s summary of the AMSARA Report is\\n\\ninexplicably misleading. Further, the Report contradicts, rather than supports, the conclusions\\n\\nthe Action Memo draws from it. These findings support Plaintiffs\\u2019 contention that Defendants\\n\\n\\n                                                  26\\n\\fdid not exercise military judgment to which the Court can defer on the narrow question of\\n\\nwhether the Hegseth Policy comports with the Fifth Amendment.\\n\\n               3.     2025 Medical Literature Review\\n\\n       The Action Memo also references the 2025 Medical Literature Review conducted by the\\n\\nOffice of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs. The Action Memo\\u2019s entire\\n\\ndiscussion of the Medical Literature Review is that it:\\n\\n               Included findings that \\u201c55% of transgender individuals\\n               experienced suicidal ideation and 29% attempted suicide in their\\n               lifetime...[and] the suicide attempt rate is estimated to be 13 times\\n               higher among transgender individuals compared to their cisgender\\n               counterparts,\\u201d \\u201ctransgender individuals are approximately twice as\\n               likely to receive a psychiatric diagnosis compared to cisgender\\n               individuals,\\u201d and that the strength of the evidence on transgender\\n               mental health and gender-affirming care is low to moderate.\\n\\nAction Memo at 4\\u20135 (quoting Dkt. 73-25 (Med. Lit. Rev.) at 2\\u20133).\\n\\n       No one summarizing the Review in good faith could draw these conclusions. To start,\\n\\nthe Medical Literature Review did not survey studies on transgender persons in military service:\\n\\ni.e., individuals already found to be physically and mentally fit. Dkt. 73-25 at 2; see also Defs.\\n\\nConcession, Tr. (Mar. 12, 2025) at 116\\u201317. So it can shed little light on how transgender\\n\\npersons fare in the military. See also Defs. Concession, Tr. (Mar. 12, 2025) at 117. For that\\n\\nanalysis, the Court refers to the AMSARA Report, which, again, found similar rates of\\n\\npsychotherapy for transgender and other servicemembers.\\n\\n       Second, the suicide conclusions of the Medical Literature Review undercut banning\\n\\ntransgender persons from the military. To start, the military already restricts individuals with\\n\\nsuicidal tendencies from enlisting. See DoDI 6130.03, Vol. 1, at 6.28(m). Moreover, the studies\\n\\nunder review confirm that transgender persons are not inherently mentally unfit. Instead, the\\n\\nstudies cited find that transgender suicide rates are influenced by external factors, such as\\n\\n                                                 27\\n\\f\\u201cgender identity-related disparities, discrimination, lack of family and social support, barriers to\\n\\ngender-affirming care, co-occurring mental health conditions, economic instability, and\\n\\nexperiences of violence and victimization.\\u201d Dkt. 73-25 at 3. The studies also show \\u201cthat suicide\\n\\nrisk among transgender . . . individuals is mitigated by access to gender-affirming care, strong\\n\\nsocial and family support, legal and social recognition, affirming mental health services,\\n\\ncommunity connectedness, and protections against discrimination.\\u201d Id.; see also Defs.\\n\\nConcession, Tr. (Mar. 12, 2025) at 118\\u201319.\\n\\n       Third, each meta-study cited found that Gender-Affirming Hormone Treatment and\\n\\nGender-Affirming Surgery treatment improves psychological well-being, mental health, and\\n\\nquality of life. See id. at 4\\u20136. Each treatment method reduces gender dysphoria, depression,\\n\\nanxiety, psychological distress, and depressive symptoms. Id. Further, \\u201clong-term studies show\\n\\nthat regret rates are extremely low, with most individuals reporting improved quality of life,\\n\\nbody image satisfaction, and overall well-being.\\u201d Id. at 5.\\n\\n       The Court does not question military judgment as to what constitutes as disqualifying\\n\\nmedical events. The Court instead finds that the Action Memo\\u2019s summary of the 2025 Medical\\n\\nLiterature Review is inexplicably misleading. Further, the Review contradicts, rather than\\n\\nsupports, the conclusions the Action Memo draw from it. These findings support Plaintiffs\\u2019\\n\\ncontention that Defendants did not exercise military judgment to which the Court can defer on\\n\\nthe narrow question of whether the Hegseth Policy comports with the Fifth Amendment.\\n\\n               4.     Military Costs\\n\\n       The Action Memo concludes that \\u201cthe costs associated with [gender-affirming] health\\n\\ncare,\\u201d which it estimates at $52 million over 10 years, make service by transgender members\\n\\nincompatible with military readiness. Action Memo at 5; Dkt. 66 at 5. It is impossible to see\\n\\n\\n                                                 28\\n\\fhow. Assuming $5.2 million per year, estimated transgender care costs was fifty-seven hundred-\\n\\nthousandths of a percent (00.00057%) of total military spending for 2024.19 Perhaps\\n\\nunderstandably, then, Former Deputy Undersecretary Skelly testified, and Defendants do not\\n\\nrebut, that under the Austin Policy, the Assistant Secretary for Health Affairs or Defense Health\\n\\nAgency staff raised no concerns about the cost of treating transgender servicemembers. See Dkt.\\n\\n72-73 \\u00b6 14; see also Dkt. 72-68 \\u00b6\\u00b6 8\\u20139.\\n\\n       Defendants could fairly respond that whether $5.2 million per year is a \\u201crounding error\\u201d\\n\\nof the overall budget is not the right comparator. Instead, they could argue, the number must be\\n\\ncompared to similar costs the military incurs. Had Defendants done that comparison\\u2014indeed,\\n\\nhad they done any comparison\\u2014they might have a point. But the Action Memo makes no\\n\\ncomparison. See Defs. Concession, Tr. (Mar. 12, 2025) at 144\\u201345. It states that the amount to\\n\\ntreat gender dysphoria is $52 million over ten years and that this amount is too high. Action\\n\\nMemo at 5. Comparisons are important, though. For example, the Department spent\\n\\napproximately $41 million for Viagra in 2023, compared to an estimated $5.2 million for gender-\\n\\naffirming care. See Dkt. 72-68 \\u00b6 9.20 Defendants do not explain why the former (and every\\n\\nother medical cost) is acceptable while the latter requires banning transgender persons from\\n\\nmilitary service. Tr. (Mar. 12, 2025) at 150\\u201354.\\n\\n       Nor do Defendants analyze the costs of discharging and replacing thousands of trained\\n\\nservicemembers, many with decades of experience and specialized skills. This is not an idle\\n\\n\\n\\n19\\n  From January 1, 2016, to May 14, 2021, the military provided gender-affirming care to 1,892\\nactive duty servicemembers. Dkt. 66-1 at 2. That number represents about two hundredths of\\none percent (0.02%) of the 9.5 million beneficiaries TRICARE covered in 2024. See id.\\n20\\n  See also Beyond the Budget: Addressing Financial Accountability in the Department of\\nDefense: Joint Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Nat. Sec., the Border, & Foreign Affairs & the\\nSubcomm. on Gov\\u2019t Operations & the Fed. Workforce, 118th Cong. 49 (2023).\\n                                                29\\n\\fquestion. The military\\u2019s practice of discharging gay and lesbian servicemembers under \\u201cDon\\u2019t\\n\\nAsk, Don\\u2019t Tell\\u201d \\u201ccost taxpayers more than $600 million.\\u201d Dkt. 77-1 at 19 (cleaned up). Even a\\n\\nsixth of that number would be twenty times the annual cost of care for gender dysphoria. Nor do\\n\\nDefendants analyze whether the military could save the same costs, or more, in other areas and\\n\\nwithout excluding a class of people.\\n\\n       The Court does not question military judgment concerning how it should apportion its\\n\\nfunds. Nor does the Court find that the military must undertake an entire budget review before\\n\\nconcluding some costs are unacceptably high. But there must be some benchmark. Citing a\\n\\nnumber\\u2014devoid of any context or analysis\\u2014and concluding that the number is too high does\\n\\nnot support banning transgender persons from military service. If it did, courts would have to\\n\\naccept any cost amount the military cites to justify any policy.\\n\\n               5.     Missing Evidence\\n\\n       If the Military Ban goes into effect, it will upend lives and ruin the careers of thousands\\n\\nof persons. Given this potential impact, the evidence not in the record is striking. Defendants\\n\\nclaim transgender persons impact military readiness, but they acknowledge the DoD does not\\n\\ntrack individuals \\u201cby gender identity and has no means of searching for [the number of]\\n\\n\\u2018transgender individuals.\\u2019\\u201d Dkt. 66 at 5; see also Defs. Concession, Tr. (Mar. 12, 2025) at 173.\\n\\nNot only that, but DoD\\u2019s own Public Affairs Guidance on the Military Ban acknowledges that\\n\\n\\u201c[w]e [DoD] do not have an exact number of active-duty Service members diagnosed with\\n\\ngender dysphoria.\\u201d Dkt. 79-1 at 6. And it admits that \\u201c[w]e [DoD] do not have [a breakdown of\\n\\nindividuals in the military by service, gender, race, and occupation] readily available.\\u201d Id.\\n\\n       Without answers to these basic questions, Defendants cannot explain how transgender\\n\\npersons impact military readiness.

How many have, like\\n\\nPlaintiffs, served with distinction and are fit for continued service? How many are stable after a\\n\\ngender dysphoria diagnosis? How many have had deployment issues? How many will be\\n\\neligible for an exemption? How many will be discharged? What amount of irreplaceable\\n\\nexperience will the military then lose? See Defs. Concession, Tr.

High-ranking military leaders who\\n\\nimplemented the Austin Policy have submitted sworn declarations in which they testify, from\\n\\npersonal experience, that transgender persons serving openly has improved, not decreased,\\n\\nmilitary preparedness. Of the four declarations by high-ranking military leaders, Defendants\\n\\nrebut only one aspect of one of them. The Court briefly reviews that testimony, including\\n\\nDefendants\\u2019 sole rebuttal, here.\\n\\n                1.     Plaintiffs\\u2019 Declarants\\n\\n       Declarant Carlos Del Toro was the 78th Secretary of the Navy. Dkt. 72-79 \\u00b6 1. Former\\n\\nSecretary Del Toro had \\u201coversite [sic] responsibilities over all personnel matters affecting the\\n\\nNavy and Marine Corps, including implementation of . . . policies regarding service by\\n\\ntransgender personnel.\\u201d Id. \\u00b6 6. Secretary Del Toro testifies that \\u201c[b]ased on [his] direct\\n\\n                                                32\\n\\fexperience and observation, transgender service members who meet the standards required for\\n\\ntheir positions serve effectively and contribute positively to unit readiness.\\u201d Id. \\u00b6 7. Notably,\\n\\nduring Secretary Del Toro\\u2019s \\u201cthree and a half years as Secretary,\\u201d he \\u201creviewed thousands of\\n\\ndisciplinary cases and personnel matters,\\u201d yet he cannot \\u201crecollect a single disciplinary case or\\n\\nperformance issue related directly to a service member\\u2019s transgender status.\\u201d Id. \\u00b6 8.\\n\\n       Former Secretary Del Toro testifies that \\u201cbeing transgender does not inherently affect a\\n\\nservice member\\u2019s ability to meet [military] standards or to deploy worldwide,\\u201d and that \\u201c[a]ny\\n\\nsuggestion to the contrary contradicts the actual documented performance of transgender service\\n\\nmembers in our forces.\\u201d Id. \\u00b6 10. He further testifies that \\u201c[t]here is no evidence-based\\n\\njustification for excluding from service someone who meets all applicable standards merely\\n\\nbecause they are transgender,\\u201d and that \\u201c[s]uch exclusion would harm military readiness by\\n\\ndepriving our force of qualified personnel who have proven their ability to serve.\\u201d Id. \\u00b6 13.\\n\\n\\u201cContrary to speculative concerns, [he] has observed that allowing transgender individuals to\\n\\nserve strengthens unit cohesion by fostering honesty and mutual trust,\\u201d and that \\u201cexcluding\\n\\ntransgender individuals from military service is destabilizing to good order and discipline.\\u201d Id.\\n\\n\\u00b6\\u00b6 15, 17.\\n\\n       Declarant Alex Wagner is the former Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Manpower\\n\\nand Reserve Affairs.

Mr. Wagner was a member of the working group convened\\n\\nby the Acting Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness \\u201cto formulate policy\\n\\noptions for DoD regarding transgender service members.\\u201d Id. \\u00b6 9. Mr. Wagner testifies that he\\n\\nis \\u201cnot aware of any negative impact . . . on . . . our overall military readiness.\\u201d Id. \\u00b6 27. Rather,\\n\\nhe testifies that the Austin Policy \\u201cfoster[ed] openness and trust among team members . . .\\n\\nthereby engender[ing] stronger unit cohesion.\\u201d Id. \\u00b6 28. He is \\u201cnot aware of any complaints\\n\\n\\n                                                 33\\n\\fregarding unit cohesion\\u201d or \\u201creadiness.\\u201d Id. \\u00b6\\u00b6 32, 33.

Dkt. 72-69 \\u00b6 1. Ms. Bourcicot also served on the working\\n\\ngroup convened to study the new policy allowing transgender persons to serve. Id. \\u00b6 12. Ms.\\n\\nBourcicot testifies that she reviewed each request submitted by a transgender servicemember\\n\\nwishing to transition and that she \\u201cmade a recommendation on whether to grant the service\\n\\nmember\\u2019s request.\\u201d Id. \\u00b6 19. To her \\u201cbest recollection,\\u201d \\u201cevery request [she] received met the\\n\\nrequirements of the policy, and every requesting service member met the necessary standards for\\n\\nserving.\\u201d Id. Ms. Bourcicot \\u201cobserved no negative impact from permitting transgender service\\n\\nin the Army [] on our military capabilities\\u201d and is \\u201cunaware of any complaints regarding unit\\n\\ncohesion resulting from permitting transgender people to serve.\\u201d Id. \\u00b6\\u00b6 23, 26.\\n\\n       Declarant Shawn G.

Dkt. 72-72 \\u00b6 1.\\n\\nMr. Skelly\\u2019s responsibilities \\u201cincluded implementing the policy permitting service by\\n\\ntransgender troops.\\u201d Id. \\u00b6 8. Mr. Skelly testifies that the Austin Policy \\u201cenable[d] [the] military\\n\\nto retain highly trained and experienced service members by applying the same standards to\\n\\ntransgender service members that are applied to others.\\u201d Id. \\u00b6 10. He further testifies that \\u201c[t]he\\n\\ntransgender service policy has not negatively impacted readiness,\\u201d id. \\u00b6 11, and that he is \\u201cnot\\n\\naware of any complaints regarding unit cohesion resulting from the Austin [P]olicy,\\u201d id. \\u00b6 13.\\n\\n\\u201cTo the extent the Austin [P]olicy has had any appreciable impact on unit cohesion, it has\\n\\nimproved unit cohesion by fostering increased trust among team members.\\u201d Id. \\u201cPersonnel\\n\\n\\n                                                34\\n\\fpolicies that allow transgender service members to be evaluated based on skill and merit . . . do\\n\\nnot jeopardize the military\\u2019s mission of protecting the United States, but strengthen it.\\u201d Id. \\u00b6 14.\\n\\n               2.     Challenge to One Declarant\\u2019s Testimony\\n\\n       The Court informed Defendants that, if not challenged, it would accept the testimony\\n\\ncontained in Plaintiffs\\u2019 third-party declarations as findings of fact. Min. Order Feb. 10, 2025. It\\n\\nrepeatedly informed Defendants that they had a right to cross-examine these witnesses, but\\n\\nDefendants declined to do so. Tr. (Feb. 18, 2025) at 121\\u201322; Tr. (Mar. 12, 2025) at 128\\u201329.\\n\\n       Defendants did file the sworn declaration of Timothy D. Dill, Assistant Secretary of\\n\\nDefense for Manpower and Reserve Affairs, Dkt. 52, to challenge the sworn declaration of\\n\\nGilbert R. Cisneros, Jr., former Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, Dkt.\\n\\n13-30, filed by Plaintiffs. Mr. Cisneros was responsible for overseeing implementation of the\\n\\nAustin Policy and testifies that, \\u201c[i]f there were complaints or problems about transgender\\n\\nservice members, I would have known of them through my role as Under Secretary of Defense\\n\\nfor Personnel and Readiness.\\u201d Dkt. 13-30 \\u00b6\\u00b6 12, 17. He further testifies that \\u201c[i]n that role, I did\\n\\nhear complaints about some other issues, but I never received or heard about a single complaint\\n\\nrelating to transgender service members.\\u201d Id. To rebut this, Mr. Dill testifies that \\u201cit would be\\n\\nhighly unusual for individualized service member complaints regarding unit cohesion, military\\n\\nreadiness, medical readiness, deployability, and lethality to reach the level of the Under\\n\\nSecretary [Mr. Cisneros].\\u201d Dkt. 52-1 \\u00b6 6. In response, Mr. Cisneros testifies that:\\n\\n               [Mr. Dill\\u2019s statement] does not accurately describe my degree of\\n               awareness of these matters as Under Secretary of Defense for\\n               Personnel and Readiness. As the Under Secretary in charge of\\n               readiness, it was my responsibility to be aware of unit cohesion,\\n               military readiness, medical readiness, deployability, and lethality.\\n               If a unit or service was dealing with readiness issues due to the\\n               service by transgender service members, that would have been\\n               brought to my attention.\\n\\n                                                 35\\n\\fDkt. 53-1 \\u00b6 4. Mr. Cisneros provides an example concerning his oversight of Junior ROTC units\\n\\nto support this testimony. Id. \\u00b6 6. As between Mr. Cisneros, who testifies under oath as to his\\n\\nown experience, and Mr. Dill, who testifies under oath as to what he thinks Mr. Cisneros\\u2019s\\n\\npersonal experience would have been, the Court naturally credits Mr. Cisneros. That said, the\\n\\nCourt would reach the same conclusions even if it did not credit this part of Mr. Cisneros\\u2019s\\n\\ntestimony.\\n\\n        Defendants argue generally that the declarants cannot have personal knowledge that \\u201cno\\n\\ncomplaint\\u201d was ever filed concerning a transgender servicemember. Tr. (Feb. 18, 2025) at 124\\u2013\\n\\n26. The Court accepts that contention and will not rely on these declarations for the proposition\\n\\nthat no complaint anywhere in the Armed Forces ever arose. However, as former high-ranking\\n\\nofficials at DoD directly involved in either drafting or implementing the Austin Policy,\\n\\nPlaintiffs\\u2019 declarants have personal knowledge concerning the impact of transgender persons\\n\\nserving openly on military preparedness. And they unanimously conclude that they have had\\n\\neither no detrimental effect or have had a positive one. Defendants concede that they have\\n\\nproffered no evidence to contradict these assertions. Tr. (Feb. 18, 2025) at 120.\\n\\n        The Court, at this early stage of the litigation, accepts Plaintiffs\\u2019 declarants\\u2019 uncontested\\n\\ntestimony as part of its findings of fact.\\n\\n                                    STANDARD OF REVIEW\\n\\n        The \\u201ctraditional goal of a preliminary injunction is to preserve [the] status quo,\\u201d which is\\n\\n\\u201cthe last uncontested status which preceded the pending controversy.\\u201d Huisha-Huisha v.\\n\\nMayorkas, 27 F.4th 718, 733 (D.C. Cir. 2022). A party seeking preliminary injunctive relief\\n\\nmust show that the following factors, taken together, weigh in favor of an injunction: (1) \\u201cthat he\\n\\nis likely to succeed on the merits,\\u201d (2) \\u201cthat he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence\\n\\n\\n                                                  36\\n\\fof preliminary relief,\\u201d (3) \\u201cthat the balance of equities tips in his favor,\\u201d and (4) \\u201cthat an\\n\\ninjunction is in the public interest.\\u201d Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).\\n\\nThe last two factors \\u201cmerge\\u201d into one \\u201cwhen the Government is the opposing party,\\u201d as it is here.\\n\\nNken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009).\\n\\n       Circuits differ in their reading of Winter\\u2019s four factor test; some allow a strong showing\\n\\nof one factor to make up for a weaker showing on another, see, e.g., All. for the Wild Rockies v.\\n\\nCottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1131\\u201335 (9th Cir. 2011) (employing this sliding-scale approach), while\\n\\nothers require each element to be proven independently, see, e.g., Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC\\n\\nv. 6.56 Acres of Land, Owned by Powell, 915 F.3d 197, 215 n.7 (4th Cir. 2019).\\n\\n       Historically, this Circuit evaluated the factors on a sliding scale. See, e.g., Davenport v.\\n\\nInt\\u2019l Bhd. of Teamsters, 166 F.3d 356, 360\\u201361 (D.C. Cir. 1999). But it has read Winter \\u201cat least\\n\\nto suggest if not hold\\u201d that the moving party faces \\u201ca more demanding burden\\u201d under which \\u201ca\\n\\nlikelihood of success is an independent, freestanding requirement for a preliminary injunction.\\u201d\\n\\nSherley v. Sebelius, 644 F.3d 388, 392\\u201393 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (cleaned up). Yet it has repeatedly\\n\\n\\u201cdeclined to take sides\\u201d on whether Winter so held. Am Meat Inst. v. USDA, 746 F.3d 1065,\\n\\n1074 (D.C. Cir. 2014), reinstated in relevant part by 760 F.3d 18 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (en banc); see\\n\\nalso Changji Esquel Textile Co. v. Raimondo, 40 F.4th 716, 726 (D.C. Cir. 2022).\\n\\n       Because each of the four factors favors granting preliminary injunctive relief, Plaintiffs\\n\\nwould prevail under either the sliding-scale or independent-factor approach. The Court therefore\\n\\nremains on the sidelines of this ongoing debate.\\n\\n                          PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ANALYSIS\\n\\n       I.      PLAINTIFFS\\u2019 COMPLAINT IS RIPE\\n       Defendants contend that this Court lacks jurisdiction because Plaintiffs did not exhaust\\n\\ntheir administrative remedies. Opp. at 26\\u201328. Because some Plaintiffs are current military\\n\\n                                                  37\\n\\fpersonnel, they claim, those Plaintiffs must exhaust military tribunals before involving \\u201ccivilian\\n\\ncourts.\\u201d Id. at 27 (quoting Bois v. Marsh, 801 F.2d 462, 468 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (cleaned up)). Not\\n\\nso.\\n\\n        Plaintiffs claim the Military Ban violates the Fifth Amendment. Defendants cite no\\n\\nsupport for their contention that exhaustion is required for claims that raise a constitutional\\n\\nchallenge to agency action. Opp. at 15-18. In Axon Enter. Inc. v. FTC, the Supreme Court held\\n\\nthat petitioners could raise, without exhausting their remedies, a challenge \\u201ccollateral to any\\n\\ndecisions the [agencies] could make in individual enforcement proceedings.\\u201d 598 U.S. 175, 195\\n\\n(2023). Axon involved a challenge to the constitutionality of the agency itself, but its reasoning\\n\\nis informative here. Plaintiffs claim that subjecting them to discharge proceedings, verbal\\n\\ndegradation, and reputational damage, though they are physically and mentally fit to serve, are\\n\\n\\u201chere-and-now\\u201d injuries of being subjected to an unconstitutional policy. Id. at 192. No relief\\n\\nordered by a military tribunal can remedy such harm. Id.\\n\\n        Exhaustion is also futile. Defendants push back by stating: \\u201c[t]he [obviously futile]\\n\\nexception applies only when \\u2018the agency will most certainly deny any relief \\u2026 because it has a\\n\\npreconceived notion on \\u2026 the matter.\\u2019\\u201d Opp. at 17 (quoting Randolph-Sheppard Vendors of\\n\\nAm. v. Weinberger, 795 F.2d 90, 107 (D.C. Cir. 1986)). They claim the relief here is not\\n\\npreordained. It is. The Hegseth Policy lays out in detail the military\\u2019s \\u201cpreconceived notion\\u201d on\\n\\nPlaintiffs\\u2019 service.\\n\\n        Defendants finally claim that \\u201cdevelopment of a factual record\\u201d by the military will assist\\n\\nthe Court in its analysis of the involuntary separation. Opp. at 17. What more facts does the\\n\\nCourt need as to the individual Plaintiffs? Each active-duty Plaintiff is subject to the Hegseth\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                 38\\n\\fPolicy, no Plaintiff is eligible for a waiver, and the military will discharge each one.

By \\u201cdefer\\u201d they basically mean the Court\\n\\nmust side with the military\\u2019s position, end-stop.

But even employing a\\n\\nlower scrutiny standard, Plaintiffs retain their constitutional rights. Notwithstanding the\\n\\ndeference the Court owes it, the military still must show that burdening these Plaintiffs\\u2019 equal\\n\\nprotection rights is related to furthering a government interest. And as discussed throughout this\\n\\nopinion, the military\\u2019s justifications \\u201ccome up very short.\\u201d Singh, 56 F.4th at 107.\\n\\n       Singh also instructed the district court to enter a preliminary injunction that altered the\\n\\nstatus quo. That itself is rare because \\u201ccourts are institutionally wary of granting relief that\\n\\ndisrupts, rather than preserves, the status quo, especially when that relief cannot be undone if the\\n\\n\\n                                                  41\\n\\fnon-movant ultimately wins on the merits.\\u201d Id. at 95. Here, the Military Ban\\u2014not an\\n\\ninjunction\\u2014would upend the status quo. Further, if Defendants later prevail on the merits, they\\n\\nwill not be prejudiced as was the case in Singh.\\n\\n       Sidestepping Singh, Defendants point instead to Rostker v. Goldberg, 453 U.S. 57, 66\\n\\n(1981), in which the Supreme Court upheld a law that required only men to register for the draft.\\n\\nWithout question, Rostker is an example of the Supreme Court showing deference to military\\n\\njudgment, even when it implicates sex-based distinctions. Defendants, overstep, however, in\\n\\nclaiming that in Rostker \\u201cthe Court\\u2019s approach most closely resembles rational-basis review.\\u201d\\n\\nOpp. at 38. Even in Rostker, the Supreme Court deferred because it found that Congress had\\n\\nacted with \\u201cdeliberate consideration,\\u201d rather than \\u201cunthinkingly\\u201d or \\u201creflexively.\\u201d Id. at 72, 83.\\n\\nThe Military Ban\\u2019s 30-day incubation period pales next to the \\u201chearings, floor debate, and in\\n\\ncommittee\\u201d discussions that precipitated the law in Rostker. Id. at 72.\\n\\n       Further, the Supreme Court\\u2019s later-decided United States v. Virginia (VMI) decision\\n\\n\\u201cdrastically revise[d] [the Court\\u2019s] established standards for reviewing sex-based classifications.\\u201d\\n\\n518 U.S. at 566 (Scalia, J., dissenting). When reviewing sex-based classifications, \\u201cthe\\n\\nreviewing court must determine with the proffered justification is exceedingly persuasive. The\\n\\nburden of justification is demanding and it rests entirely on the State.\\u201d VMI, 518 U.S. at 533.\\n\\nThat is intermediate, not rational, review.\\n\\n       Defendants\\u2019 reliance on Goldman v. Weinberger is similarly unpersuasive. 475 U.S. 503\\n\\n(1986). Defendants argue that judicial \\u201creview of military regulations challenged on First\\n\\nAmendment grounds is far more deferential than constitutional review of similar laws or\\n\\nregulations designed for civilian society.\\u201d Opp. at 37\\u201338; see also 475 U.S. at 507. Sure. But\\n\\nthis is not a First Amendment case. And the facts of Goldman bear no relation to those here.\\n\\n\\n                                                   42\\n\\fGoldman asked whether an Orthodox Jewish servicemember \\u201ccan wear a yarmulke while in\\n\\nuniform.\\u201d Id. at 504. The question here is whether transgender persons can wear the uniform at\\n\\nall. The Supreme Court would likely not have signed off on the military banning all Orthodox\\n\\nJews who had ever worn a yarmulke from service.\\n\\n               3.     Trump v. Hawaii Confirms that the Military Is Not Owed Blind\\n                      Deference\\n\\n       To argue the Court must defer to the military\\u2019s judgment here, Defendants rely heavily\\n\\non Trump v. Hawaii. See Opp. at 39, 50\\u201352; 585 U.S. 667 (2018). That reliance is misplaced.\\n\\n       A week after taking office in 2017, President Trump issued what he had previously called\\n\\na \\u201cMuslim Ban.\\u201d By executive order, he limited entry into the United States by foreign nationals\\n\\nfrom Muslim-majority countries. Id. at 676. A month and a half later, after an injunction\\n\\nblocked the policy, President Trump replaced his first executive order with a second executive\\n\\norder. Id. The second order restricted entry of foreign nationals from six of the original seven\\n\\ncountries, though it allowed waivers on a case-by-case basis. Id. After lower courts again\\n\\nenjoined the order, the Supreme Court stayed the injunctions. Id. at 677.\\n\\n       In September 2017, after the Secretary of Homeland Security completed a review of the\\n\\npolicy, President Trump issued yet another iteration, Proclamation No. 9645. Id. The\\n\\nProclamation implemented entry restrictions for foreign nationals from eight countries \\u201cwhose\\n\\nsystems for managing and sharing information about their nationals the President deemed\\n\\ninadequate.\\u201d Id. Plaintiffs in Trump v. Hawaii challenged it as a violation of the Establishment\\n\\nClause, alleging that it was \\u201cmotivated not by concerns pertaining to national security but by\\n\\nanimus toward Islam.\\u201d Id. at 681. They were unsuccessful.\\n\\n       The Supreme Court rejected Plaintiffs\\u2019 contention that the new policy simply continued\\n\\nthe animus they claimed permeated the first one. Id. at 706. First, Proclamation No. 9645\\n\\n                                                43\\n\\f\\u201csa[id] nothing about religion.\\u201d Id. at 706. It was a \\u201cfacially neutral policy denying certain\\n\\nforeign nationals the privilege of admission\\u201d to the United States. Id. at 710. It did not mention\\n\\nIslam or any other religion. Additionally, the first ban went into effect seven days after President\\n\\nTrump was inaugurated. Id. at 676. Proclamation No. 9645 came 8 months later and \\u201creflect[ed]\\n\\nthe results of a worldwide review process undertaken by multiple Cabinet officials and their\\n\\nagencies.\\u201d Id. at 707. Because of the \\u201cthoroughness\\u201d of the \\u201cmulti-agency review,\\u201d the\\n\\nSupreme Court ultimately deferred to the Executive\\u2019s determination that the ban was important\\n\\nfor national security. Id. at 707\\u201308.\\n\\n        Second, Proclamation No. 9645 restricted entry for foreign nationals from some Muslim\\n\\nmajority countries, but not all, and it applied to foreign nationals of all religions. Id. at 707.\\n\\nBecause the policy did not encompass all Muslim majority countries, the Supreme Court\\n\\nreasoned that \\u201cthe determinations were justified by the distinct conditions in each country.\\u201d Id.\\n\\nThird, it found Proclamation No. 9645 to be \\u201cexpressly premised on legitimate purposes:\\n\\npreventing entry of nationals who cannot be adequately vetted and inducing other nations to\\n\\nimprove their practices.\\u201d Id. at 706. It found that the restrictions reflected in the Proclamation\\n\\nwere designed to achieve those purposes. Id. at 708\\u201309.\\n\\n        Comparing the facts of the policy upheld in Hawaii to the ones here is informative.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                  44\\n\\f                     Trump v.

It does so in the rest of this\\n\\nOpinion.\\n\\n            B.     Intermediate Scrutiny\\n\\n        The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides that \\u201c[n]o person shall be . . .\\n\\ndeprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\\u201d U.S. Const. amend. V. While\\n\\n\\u201cnot as explicit a guarantee of equal treatment as the Fourteenth Amendment,\\u201d the Supreme\\n\\nCourt has held that \\u201cthe Constitution imposes upon federal, state, and local government actors\\n\\nthe same obligation to respect the personal right to equal protection of the laws.\\u201d Adarand\\n\\nConstructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 213, 231\\u201332 (1995) (emphasis added).\\n\\n        The parties dispute whether the Military Ban denies Plaintiffs equal protection as a quasi-\\n\\nsuspect class. Laws that do not classify based on a suspect or quasi-suspect class \\u201c[are]\\n\\n\\n                                                   45\\n\\fpresumed to be valid and will be sustained if the classification drawn . . . is rationally related to a\\n\\nlegitimate state interest.\\u201d City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 440 (1985).\\n\\nLaws that discriminate based on a quasi-suspect classification must survive intermediate\\n\\nscrutiny. The government \\u201cmust show \\u2018at least that the [challenged] classification serves\\n\\nimportant governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed are substantially\\n\\nrelated to the achievement of those objectives.\\u2019\\u201d Sessions v. Morales-Santana, 582 U.S. 47, 59\\n\\n(2017) (quoting VMI, 518 U.S. at 533).\\n\\n       Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claim that the Military Ban is subject to\\n\\nintermediate scrutiny because it classifies based on sex and transgender status, two distinct quasi-\\n\\nsuspect classes. Plaintiffs are also likely to succeed on their claim that the Military Ban fails\\n\\nintermediate scrutiny.\\n\\n               1.        The Military Ban Classifies on the Basis of Sex\\n\\n       The Supreme Court has recognized that it is \\u201cimpossible to discriminate against a person\\n\\nfor being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on\\n\\nsex.\\u201d Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., 590 U.S. 644, 660 (2020). Plaintiffs claim that the logic of\\n\\nBostock applies in the equal protection context; Defendants disagree. Plaintiffs have the better\\n\\nargument.\\n\\n                         a.     The Logic of Bostock Applies to the Equal Protection Analysis\\n\\n       In Bostock, the Supreme Court considered whether firing an employee for being\\n\\ntransgender or homosexual constituted sex discrimination. Bostock, 590 U.S. at 650\\u201352. The\\n\\ncase arose under Title VII, which prohibits discrimination \\u201cbecause of . . . sex.\\u201d Id. at 655\\n\\n(quoting 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1)). In holding that firing an employee for being transgender\\n\\ndid in fact constitute sex discrimination, Justice Neil M. Gorsuch asserted that it is \\u201cimpossible\\n\\nto discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating\\n                                                  46\\n\\fagainst that individual based on sex.\\u201d Id. at 660. To illustrate this point, Justice Gorsuch offered\\n\\na hypothetical involving an employer and two employees. See id. The two hypothetical\\n\\nemployees were identical in every way except that one was a transgender woman and the other a\\n\\ncisgender woman. See id. Justice Gorsuch explained that if the hypothetical employer fires only\\n\\nthe transgender woman because she is transgender, it has \\u201cintentionally penalize[d]\\u201d her \\u201cfor\\n\\ntraits or actions that it tolerates in an employee identified as female at birth.\\u201d Id. He concluded\\n\\nthat \\u201cif changing the employee\\u2019s sex would have yielded a different choice by the employer,\\u201d\\n\\nthen the discrimination is based on sex. Id. at 659\\u201360.\\n\\n       The Court agrees with Defendants that Bostock\\u2019s holding is cabined to Title VII. Id. at\\n\\n660; Opp. at 34. But its reasoning is not. The Supreme Court deduced it impossible\\u2014end\\n\\nstop\\u2014to discriminate against a transgender person without discriminating against that person\\n\\nbased on sex. Bostock, 590 U.S. at 660. Three circuit courts have applied that same logic in the\\n\\nFifth Amendment context. The Fourth Circuit en banc has held that: \\u201cdiscriminating on the basis\\n\\nof [a gender dysphoria] diagnosis is discriminating on the basis of gender identity and sex.\\u201d\\n\\nKadel v. Folwell, 100 F.4th 122, 141 (4th Cir. 2024) (en banc) (cleaned up). Ditto the Ninth\\n\\nCircuit. See Hecox v. Little, 104 F.4th 1061, 1079 (9th Cir. 2024). Ditto the Tenth Circuit. See\\n\\nFowler v. Stitt, 104 F.4th 770, 793 (10th Cir. 2024).\\n\\n       On the other hand, the Sixth and Eleventh Circuits have declined to borrow Bostock\\u2019s\\n\\ndiscrimination analysis because of \\u201c[d]ifferences between the language of [Title VII] and the\\n\\nConstitution.\\u201d L.W. ex rel. Williams v. Skrmetti, 83 F.4th 460, 484 (6th Cir. 2023); see also\\n\\nEknes-Tucker v. Governor of Ala., 80 F.4th 1205, 1228\\u201329 (11th Cir. 2023). First, \\u201cTitle VII\\n\\ncovers disparate impact claims\\u201d while \\u201cthe [Fifth] Amendment does not.\\u201d L.W., 83 F.4th at 485.\\n\\nSecond, Title VII is limited to certain classifications, and it does not incorporate tiers of scrutiny.\\n\\n\\n                                                  47\\n\\fBostock, 590 U.S. at 655. In contrast, the Fifth Amendment \\u201caddresses all manner of distinctions\\n\\nbetween persons\\u201d and \\u201cimplies different degrees of judicial scrutiny.\\u201d Students for Fair\\n\\nAdmissions, Inc. v. President & Fellows of Harvard Coll., 600 U.S. 181, 308 (2023) (Gorsuch,\\n\\nJ., concurring). Third, Title VII also contains many defenses\\u2014such as \\u201cbona fide occupational\\n\\nqualifications and bona fide seniority and merit systems\\u201d\\u2014that the Fifth Amendment does not.\\n\\nL.W., 83 F.4th at 485.\\n\\n       All true. But a distinction is not necessarily one with a difference. \\u201c[N]othing about\\n\\nthese differences [] prevent[s] Bostock\\u2019s commonsense reasoning\\u2014based on the inextricable\\n\\nrelationship between transgender status and sex\\u2014from [being] appl[ied] to the initial inquiry of\\n\\nwhether there has been discrimination on the basis of sex in the equal protection context.\\u201d\\n\\nFowler, 104 F.4th at 790 (citing Bostock, 590 U.S. at 660). \\u201cAdopting Bostock\\u2019s commonsense\\n\\nexplanation for how to detect a sex-based classification does not require us to import Title VII\\u2019s\\n\\ntest for liability.\\u201d Fowler, 104 F.4th at 790\\u201391 (cleaned up). That Title VII\\u2019s defenses are\\n\\ncodified in separate provisions of Title VII, arguably \\u201cbel[ies] any notion that those defenses\\n\\nmust apply in equal-protection cases.\\u201d L.W., 83 F.4th at 503 n.7 (White, J., dissenting).\\n\\n       The differences between the provisions\\u2014material as they may be in some situations\\u2014\\n\\nhave no bearing on the Supreme Court\\u2019s careful step-by-step reasoning on the \\u201cinextricable\\n\\nrelationship\\u201d that exists between transgender status and sex. See Fowler, 104 F.4th at 790. The\\n\\nCourt therefore applies Bostock\\u2019s reasoning to analyze the Military Ban. In doing so, it does not\\n\\n\\u201cimport[] the Title VII test for liability,\\u201d L.W., 83 F.4th at 485, into the equal protection\\n\\nguarantee of the Fifth Amendment. Rather, it borrows Justice Gorsuch\\u2019s reasoning to conclude\\n\\nthat transgender discrimination is a form of sex discrimination for purposes of the equal\\n\\nprotection inquiry.\\n\\n\\n                                                  48\\n\\f                         b.   Application of the Military Ban to Both Males and Females Does\\n                              Not Negate Plaintiffs\\u2019 Individual Rights to Equal Protection\\n\\n       The Military Ban\\u2019s raison d\\u2019\\u00eatre is to exclude transgender persons from military service\\n\\non the basis of their sex. EO14183 posits that \\u201cexpressing a false \\u2018gender identity\\u2019 divergent\\n\\nfrom an individual\\u2019s sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service.\\u201d\\n\\nEO14183 \\u00a7 1. The Hegseth Policy declares that the DoD \\u201conly recognizes two sexes: male and\\n\\nfemale,\\u201d and that \\u201c[a]n individual\\u2019s sex is immutable, unchanging during a person\\u2019s life.\\u201d\\n\\nHegseth Policy at 3. It demands that \\u201c[a]ll Service members [] serve in accordance with their\\n\\n[biological] sex.\\u201d Id.\\n\\n       The Military Ban excludes from service transgender women because they are biologically\\n\\nmale but identify as women. Had those very same servicemembers been born female, the\\n\\nmilitary would not ban them. Is this discrimination on the basis of sex? The test is simple:\\n\\nwould changing that transgender soldier\\u2019s sex lead to a different decision by the military? Yes, a\\n\\nbiological female who identifies as a woman is not banned. Ergo, discrimination. To adopt\\n\\nJustice Gorsuch\\u2019s analysis to this case:\\n\\n               [T]ake \\u2026 a transgender person [discharged from the military] who\\n               was identified as a male at birth but who now identifies as a\\n               female. If the [military] retains an otherwise identical [soldier]\\n               who was identified as female at birth, the [military] intentionally\\n               penalizes a person identified as male at birth for traits or actions\\n               that it tolerates in [a soldier] identified as female at birth. Again,\\n               the individual [soldier\\u2019s] sex plays an unmistakable and\\n               impermissible role in the discharge decision.\\n\\nBostock, 590 U.S. at 660.\\n\\n       To this, Defendants have no answer. They argue instead that because the Military Ban\\n\\n\\u201capplies equally to males and female servicemembers,\\u201d it does not discriminate based on sex.\\n\\nDkt. 38 at 14; see also id. at 33. They focus on Justice Gorsuch\\u2019s assertion in Bostock that \\u201c[t]he\\n\\n\\n                                                 49\\n\\femployers might be onto something if Title VII only ensured equal treatment between groups of\\n\\nmen and women . . . Title VII\\u2019s plain terms and our precedents don\\u2019t care if an employer treats\\n\\nmen and women comparably as groups.\\u201d Bostock, 590 U.S. at 671; Dkt. 38 at 33; Tr. (Feb. 19,\\n\\n2025) at 35\\u201339.\\n\\n       Defendants\\u2019 argument \\u201cmisreads the Equal Protection Clause to protect particular groups,\\n\\na construction that [the Supreme Court has] tirelessly repudiated in a long line of cases\\n\\nunderstanding equal protection as a personal right.\\u201d Schuette v. Coalition to Def. Affirmative\\n\\nAction, 572 U.S. 291, 324 (2014) (Scalia, J., concurring) (cleaned up). Instead, it is a \\u201cbasic\\n\\nprinciple that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution protect persons, not\\n\\ngroups.\\u201d Adarand Constructors, 515 U.S. at 227 (considering race classification) (emphasis in\\n\\noriginal). Government actions based on sex \\u201cshould be subjected to detailed judicial inquiry to\\n\\nensure that the personal right to equal protection of the laws has not been infringed.\\u201d Id. Thus,\\n\\nin Loving v. Virginia, the Supreme Court rejected \\u201cthe notion that the mere equal application of a\\n\\nstatute containing racial classifications is enough to remove the classifications from the\\n\\nFourteenth Amendment\\u2019s proscription of all invidious racial discrimination.\\u201d 388 U.S. 1, 8\\n\\n(1967) (cleaned up).21 And in J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.B., the Supreme Court held that the\\n\\nEqual Protection Clause prohibits discrimination in jury selection on the basis of sex even though\\n\\nthe challenged practice applied equally to both sexes. 511 U.S. 127, 131, 146 (1994).\\n\\n       Defendants\\u2019 final push to distinguish Bostock centers on the \\u201cpremise\\u201d from which\\n\\nBostock proceeds. Opp. at 23. \\u201cWhile in the Title VII context individuals are generally similarly\\n\\n\\n\\n21\\n  Granted, race-based claims are subject to a higher level of scrutiny than sex-based claims in an\\nequal protection inquiry. See Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 440\\u201341. But neither the Supreme Court nor\\nthe D.C. Circuit have said that the initial question\\u2014whether there is a classification\\u2014differs\\ndepending on the classification at issue.\\n\\n                                                 50\\n\\fsituated because an individual\\u2019s homosexuality or transgender status is not relevant to\\n\\nemployment decisions, . . . men and women are not similarly situated when it comes to certain\\n\\nmilitary standards.\\u201d Id. at 23\\u201324 (cleaned up). True. But again, the Court here does not apply\\n\\nBostock or \\u201cimport[] the Title VII test for liability.\\u201d L.W., 83 F.4th at 485. It instead borrows\\n\\nJustice Gorsuch\\u2019s logic to conclude that transgender discrimination is a form of sex\\n\\ndiscrimination. And because the Military Ban targets transgender persons for disparate\\n\\ntreatment, it creates an explicit sex-based classification that requires application of intermediate\\n\\nscrutiny. See VMI, 518 U.S. at 531.\\n\\n               2.      Transgender Persons are a Quasi-Suspect Group\\n\\n       Plaintiffs argue that the Military Ban is also subject to intermediate scrutiny because\\n\\ntransgender persons are a quasi-suspect class. Neither the Supreme Court22 nor the D.C. Circuit\\n\\nhas addressed this contention. But the relevant test is well established. See Bowen v. Gilliard,\\n\\n483 U.S. 587, 602 (1987); Padula v. Webster, 822 F.2d 97, 102 (D.C. Cir. 1987). Quasi-suspect\\n\\nclasses have historically been subject to discrimination, Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 440\\u201341; they have\\n\\na defining characteristic that bears no relation to ability to contribute to society, id.; they may be\\n\\ndefined as a discrete group by obvious, immutable, or distinguishing characteristics, Bowen, 483\\n\\nU.S. at 602; and they lack political power, id.\\n\\n       The Court addresses each factor in turn. But, first, it acknowledges that the bar for\\n\\nrecognizing a new quasi-suspect class is high. As Defendants emphasize, Opp. at 35, the\\n\\nSupreme Court \\u201chas not recognized any new constitutionally protected classes in over four\\n\\ndecades[] and instead has repeatedly declined to do so.\\u201d L.W., 83 F.4th at 486.

The justification\\n\\nfor a law that discriminates against a quasi-suspect class \\u201cmust be genuine, not hypothesized or\\n\\ninvented post hoc in response to litigation.\\u201d Id. \\u201cAnd it must not rely on overbroad\\n\\ngeneralizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of males and females.\\u201d Id.\\n\\n          Defendants suggest that \\u201cample evidence supports the military\\u2019s judgment on this issue.\\u201d\\n\\nOpp. at 40. They divide their evidence into three categories: (1) military readiness, (2) unit\\n\\ncohesion, good order, and discipline, and (3) disproportionate costs. Below, the Court addresses\\n\\nthe lack of any connection between Defendants\\u2019 evidence and the Military Ban\\u2019s directives. In a\\n\\nseparate section below, see infra Analysis II.C., the Court finds that the Military Ban is littered\\n\\nwith animus and pretext. That discussion is equally applicable in assessing why the Military Ban\\n\\ndoes not survive intermediate scrutiny.\\n\\n                        a.     Military Readiness\\n\\n          Defendants first argue that DoD \\u201cis concerned about subjecting those with a history of\\n\\ngender dysphoria to the unique stresses of military life.\\u201d Opp. at 41. They explain that \\u201cany\\n\\nmental-health condition characterized by clinically significant distress or impairment in\\n                                                 57\\n\\ffunctioning raises readiness concerns.\\u201d Id. And because there is an \\u201cabsence of evidence on the\\n\\nimpact of deployment on individuals with gender dysphoria,\\u201d DoD \\u201cconcluded that this\\n\\ncondition posed readiness risks.\\u201d Id. (cleaned up). Defendants also argue that \\u201cit remains the\\n\\ncase that transition-related medical treatment . . . could render transitioning servicemembers non-\\n\\ndeployable for a potentially significant amount of time,\\u201d which could create \\u201charmful effects on\\n\\ntransitioning servicemembers\\u2019 units as a whole.\\u201d Id. at 42\\u201343 (cleaned up).\\n\\n        To support these conclusions, Defendants \\u201cexpressly relied\\u201d on the 2018 Mattis Policy,\\n\\nthe 2021 AMSARA Report, and the 2025 Medical Literature Review. Opp. at 41\\u201344. Not one\\n\\nof these supports a finding that the discriminatory means employed (banning transgender persons\\n\\nfrom serving) are substantially related to the achievement of the Ban\\u2019s objectives (military\\n\\nreadiness). First, citing the Mattis Policy, Defendants claim that there is an \\u201c\\u2018absence [of\\n\\nexperience] on the impact of deployment on individuals with gender dysphoria.\\u2019\\u201d Id. at 41\\n\\n(quoting Mattis Policy at 39). Therefore, gender dysphoria \\u201cpose[s] readiness risks.\\u201d Id. But\\n\\nthere is no absence. There may have been one in 2018 when the Mattis Policy issued. Since\\n\\nthen, however, persons with gender dysphoria have been deployed under the Austin Policy. See\\n\\nsupra Background III. That Defendants did not review the impact of their service does not mean\\n\\nit does not exist.\\n\\n        Second, the AMSARA Report supports retaining transgender persons in the military. See\\n\\nid. Of the eleven categories it studied, in ten transgender persons\\u2019 statistics were similar to or\\n\\nbetter than those for other servicemembers. Id.; see also Tr. (Mar. 12, 2025) at 78. The Action\\n\\nMemo picked the one outlier: transgender persons are evaluated more. Tr. (Mar. 12, 2025) at 47.\\n\\nBut their occurrence rates, including in psychotherapy and surgery, are similar. Id. at 68.\\n\\nDefendants\\u2019 argument that the Report found that transgender persons\\u2019 non-deployment rates\\n\\n\\n                                                 58\\n\\fwere unacceptable is incorrect. The Report expressly found that more study was needed before\\n\\nanyone could reach such a conclusion because comparator data for other servicemembers had not\\n\\nbeen collected. Dkt. 73-24 at 6.\\n\\n       Third, the 2025 Medical Literature Review does not include studies that address military\\n\\nservicemembers. It therefore does not study the effect of service on active-duty transgender\\n\\nservicemembers, all of whom have met the military\\u2019s mental fitness requirements to accede. See\\n\\nTr. (Mar. 12, 2025) at 130. Indeed, Defendants cite no contemporaneous support for their\\n\\npurported concern that those with a history of gender dysphoria are more prone to the unique\\n\\nstresses of military life. To the contrary, the Review confirms that\\u2014contrary to the presumption\\n\\nthat those who have ever had gender dysphoria cannot serve\\u2014gender dysphoria is highly\\n\\ntreatable. See id.\\n\\n       Plaintiffs, for their part, have provided evidence that disproves any relation between the\\n\\nMilitary Ban\\u2019s methods and goals. Five military leaders in charge of implementing the Austin\\n\\nPolicy each conclude that the Austin Policy was \\u201cbased on years of thoughtful policymaking\\n\\nsupported by peer-reviewed scientific research\\u201d and that it \\u201chas resulted in a stronger, not a\\n\\nweaker military.\\u201d Dkt. 72-69 \\u00b6 34. Based on their first-hand knowledge, they each also testify\\n\\nthat the Austin Policy \\u201cfosters openness and trust among team members, thereby enhancing unit\\n\\ncohesion.\\u201d Dkt. 72-74 \\u00b6 13; see also Dkt. 72-72 \\u00b6 9. They testify that the Military Ban\\u2014not the\\n\\nAustin Policy\\u2014\\u201cis harmful to the military\\u201d and \\u201cundermines unit readiness.\\u201d Dkt. 72-59 \\u00b6 38;\\n\\nsee also Dkt. 72-72 \\u00b6 21 (\\u201c[A] prohibition on service by transgender individuals would degrade\\n\\nmilitary readiness and capabilities.\\u201d). Other than a limited foundation objection as to one\\n\\ndeclarant, Defendants do not rebut this testimony.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                59\\n\\f                      b.     Unit Cohesion, Good Order, and Discipline\\n\\n       Defendants further contend that \\u201cDoD reasonably determined that exempting individuals\\n\\nwith gender dysphoria who have undergone gender transition or seek to do so from the military\\u2019s\\n\\nsex-based standards would undermine good order, discipline, steady leadership, unit cohesion,\\n\\nand ultimately military effectiveness and lethality.\\u201d Opp. at 45 (cleaned up). They speculate that\\n\\n\\u201ca contrary approach would risk, among other things, eroding reasonable expectations of privacy\\n\\nby other servicemembers.\\u201d Id. (cleaned up). Defendants also assert that \\u201cDoD has expressed\\n\\nconcerns that exempting servicemembers from sex-based standards in training and athletic\\n\\ncompetitions on the basis of gender identity would generate perceptions of unfairness in the\\n\\nranks.\\u201d Id. at 47. And per Defendants, \\u201cDoD is also concerned that exempting servicemembers\\n\\nfrom uniform and grooming standards based on gender identity would create friction in the\\n\\nranks.\\u201d Id.\\n\\n       These justifications fail. To start, the Military Ban covers those who even \\u201cexhibit\\n\\nsymptoms consistent with[] gender dysphoria.\\u201d Hegseth Policy at 1 (emphasis added). Because\\n\\nit has no guard rails\\u2014i.e., what these symptoms include, how often they can be exhibited, who\\n\\ndecides whether they are being exhibited, Def. Concession Tr. (March 12, 2025) at 14\\u201315\\u2014this\\n\\nexclusion is so broad as to capture persons who have never had gender dysphoria, and therefore\\n\\ndo not even possibly present the same \\u201cconcerns.\\u201d\\n\\n       Defendants again rely almost exclusively on the Mattis Policy. See id. at 45\\u201349. But, yet\\n\\nagain, the Mattis Policy is woefully stale. See supra Findings of Fact II.B.1. Further, the\\n\\nMilitary Ban\\u2019s justifications impermissibly rely on \\u201coverbroad generalizations about the different\\n\\ntalents, capacities, or preferences of males and females.\\u201d VMI, 518 U.S. at 533. They also\\n\\nimpermissibly rely on not only overbroad, but also derogatory generalizations about the different\\n\\n\\n                                                60\\n\\ftalents, capacities, or preferences of transgender persons. Such overbroad generalizations do not\\n\\nsuffice to show that a sweeping discriminatory ban is substantially related to military readiness\\n\\nand unit cohesion.\\n\\n       Even if the Military Ban had focused solely on those diagnosed with gender dysphoria,\\n\\nDefendants do not identify any problem that needs a new solution. Appropriate treatment for\\n\\ngender dysphoria is both \\u201ceffective\\u201d and \\u201cno more specialized or difficult than other\\n\\nsophisticated medical care the military system routinely provides.\\u201d Dkt. 32-2 at 6, 9, 15. The\\n\\n2025 Medical Literature Review the Action Memo cites concludes that gender-affirming medical\\n\\ncare is highly effective. See supra Findings of Fact II.B.3. And recall that already under DoD\\n\\nInstruction 6130.0 (Medical Standards for Appointment, Enlistment, or Induction into the\\n\\nMilitary Services), individuals with a history of gender dysphoria seeking to enlist must be\\n\\n\\u201cstable\\u201d in their gender identity for 18 months before enlistment. Third Amend. Compl. \\u00b6 263.\\n\\nDefendants do not explain why addressing a treatable condition requires excluding all persons\\n\\nwho have ever had\\u2014or even exhibited symptoms of\\u2014it. Nor do they explain why the constraint\\n\\nalready in place, 18 months of stability, is insufficient.\\n\\n       These overbroad generalizations are also contradicted by the Record. Plaintiff Talbott\\n\\ntestifies: \\u201cIn each military setting I have worked in so far\\u2014basic training, Officer Candidate\\n\\nSchool, and my Reserve unit\\u2014I have been open about my transgender status and have felt\\n\\nwelcomed by my peers and supervisors.\\u201d Dkt. 72-18 \\u00b6 18.

Since then, I have been promoted to my current rank of Major.\\u201d Dkt.\\n\\n72-20 \\u00b6 14\\u201315. Plaintiff Herrero testifies: \\u201cThe support of my leaders, peers, and subordinates\\n\\nthroughout my transition has not only made our units stronger but has also made me a more\\n\\n\\n                                                  61\\n\\feffective leader.\\u201d Dkt. 72-25 \\u00b6 16. Plaintiff Danridge testifies: \\u201cIn my time as both a Reservist\\n\\nand on active duty, my transgender status has rarely come up and has never been an issue. In\\n\\nfact, I received overwhelming support from my unit\\u2019s Commanding Officer to apply for\\n\\nOCS.\\u201d Dkt. 72-28 \\u00b6 24.\\n\\n       This testimony\\u2014which Defendants do not rebut\\u2014is a credit to the military\\u2019s ability to\\n\\nwelcome all those capable of serving. Indeed, had Defendants conferred with transgender\\n\\nservicemembers and those who serve with them, instead of making specious generalizations,\\n\\nthey might have learned that the Military Ban is little more than a solution in search of a\\n\\nproblem.\\n\\n                       c.     Disproportionate Costs\\n\\n       Defendants argue that \\u201cDoD reasonably concluded that its disproportionate expenditures\\n\\non facilitating gender transition should be better devoted elsewhere.\\u201d Opp. at 50. They explain\\n\\nthat \\u201cbetween 2015 and 2024, DoD spent $52,084,407 providing care to active-duty Service\\n\\nmembers to treat gender dysphoria\\u201d and that \\u201cmedical costs for servicemembers with gender\\n\\ndysphoria was nearly three times compared to servicemembers without this condition.\\u201d Id. at 49.\\n\\n       To support this \\u201cthree times\\u201d conclusion, Defendants rely on the Mattis Policy\\u2019s\\n\\nassessment of costs from the time before the Carter Policy was instituted through to the issuance\\n\\nof the Mattis Report (2014 to 2018). Dkt. 73-8 at 46. But the Mattis findings show that costs\\n\\nspiked after the military first began covering gender-affirming costs in September 2015, no doubt\\n\\nbecause of pent up demand. Dkt. 38-4 at 32. They began returning to baseline thereafter. Id.\\n\\nThat trend indicates two things. First, the Mattis Policy findings are outdated. Second, costs are\\n\\nlikely no longer disproportionate. This is confirmed by the AMSARA Report\\u2019s findings that\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                 62\\n\\foccurrence rates for common medical events are similar between transgender and non-\\n\\ntransgender service members. Dkt. 73-24 at 4.\\n\\n       As discussed in the Findings of Fact, Defendants cannot explain how transgender care\\n\\nhas resulted in \\u201cdisproportionate\\u201d costs for the military. See supra Findings of Fact II.B.4.\\n\\nWhen asked to provide the overall medical, psychotherapy, and surgical costs for all\\n\\nservicemembers so that some comparison could be made, Defendants could not answer. See Tr.\\n\\n(Mar. 12, 2025) at 144\\u201350. Without any source of comparison or benchmark, Defendants\\n\\ncannot claim that allowing transgender persons to serve results in \\u201cdisproportionate\\u201d costs for the\\n\\nmilitary.\\n\\n                       d.      The Hegseth Policy\\u2019s Exemption Provision\\n\\n       Defendants contend that the Hegseth Policy\\u2019s exemption provision addresses any\\n\\npotential issue. Opp. at 22\\u201323. Hardly. Transgender servicemembers can obtain an exemption\\n\\nif they show that they can safely perform all military tasks, and if retaining the servicemember\\n\\nwould support warfighting capabilities. Hegseth Policy at 8. Even then, the transgender person\\n\\ncan only continue to serve if: (1) they have been stable in their birth sex for 36 consecutive\\n\\nmonths, (2) they have never transitioned or even attempted to transition to any sex but their birth\\n\\nsex, and (3) they agree to serve in their birth sex. Id. Under this test, none of the Plaintiffs\\n\\nwould be eligible for an exemption. Indeed, it is hard to imagine anyone who could or, given the\\n\\nconstraints, would want to do so. Even with this non-exemption exemption, the Military Ban is\\n\\nnot even remotely, much less rationally or substantially, related to the Government\\u2019s goals. See\\n\\nsupra Findings of Fact II.\\n\\n       The Military Ban also prohibits the use of \\u201cinvented\\u201d pronouns used to \\u201cidentify\\u201d persons\\n\\nbecause they too are inconsistent with military readiness. EO14183 \\u00a7 4(b). This assertion makes\\n\\n\\n                                                  63\\n\\fno sense as written\\u2014all pronouns are invented and used to identify persons. That aside,\\n\\nDefendants could not even begin to identify how pronoun usage affects military readiness. Tr.\\n\\n(Mar. 12, 2025) at 198. The Court gave defense counsel the opportunity to present a witness\\u2014\\n\\nany witness\\u2014to state under oath that it does. Id. None materialized.\\n\\n                                             *****\\n\\n       Defendants have articulated important government objectives in military readiness, unit\\n\\ncohesion, and saving costs. But the Fifth Amendment requires more than pointing to such\\n\\n\\u201cbroadly formulated interests.\\u201d Singh, 56 F.4th at 97. Defendants must show that the\\n\\ndiscriminatory Military Ban is in some way substantially related to the achievement of those\\n\\nobjectives. And they must do so without relying on \\u201coverbroad generalizations about the\\n\\ndifferent talents, capacities, or preferences of males and females.\\u201d VMI, 518 U.S. at 538. They\\n\\ndo not come close. Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claim that the Military Ban fails\\n\\nintermediate scrutiny review.\\n\\n           C.     Animus\\n\\n       In our constitutional republic, citizens are free to hold and express divergent views. But\\n\\nwhen \\u201csincere, personal opposition [to a group of people] becomes enacted law and public\\n\\npolicy, the necessary consequence is to put the imprimatur of the State itself on an exclusion that\\n\\nsoon demeans or stigmatizes those whose own liberty is then denied.\\u201d Obergefell v. Hodges, 576\\n\\nU.S. 644, 672 (2015). Such is the case here. The Military Ban is soaked in animus and dripping\\n\\nwith pretext. Its language is unabashedly demeaning, its policy stigmatizes transgender persons\\n\\nas inherently unfit, and its conclusions bear no relation to fact. Thus, even if the Court analyzed\\n\\nthe Military Ban under rational basis review, it would fail.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                64\\n\\f                 1.     The Military Ban Is Fueled by Animus\\n\\n          Plaintiffs contend that because the Military Ban is fueled by animus, it fails any level of\\n\\nscrutiny. They stand on solid legal ground. Romer v. Evans: a law that \\u201cseems inexplicable by\\n\\nanything but animus toward the class it affects [] lacks a rational relationship to legitimate state\\n\\ninterests.\\u201d 517 U.S. 620, 632 (1996). Lawrence v. Texas: \\u201c[m]oral disapproval of a group\\n\\ncannot be a legitimate governmental interest under the Equal Protection Clause.\\u201d 539 U.S. 558,\\n\\n583 (2003) (O\\u2019Connor, J., concurring). United States v. Windsor: legislation intended to\\n\\n\\u201cinjure,\\u201d \\u201cstigma[tize],\\u201d \\u201cdemean,\\u201d and \\u201cdegrade\\u201d does not survive scrutiny. 570 U.S. 744, 769,\\n\\n770, 772, 774 (2013). Cleburne: a law that \\u201crest[s] on irrational prejudice\\u201d cannot stand. 473\\n\\nU.S. at 450. And U.S. Dep\\u2019t of Agric. v. Moreno: \\u201ca bare . . . desire to harm a politically\\n\\nunpopular group cannot constitute a legitimate governmental interest.\\u201d 413 U.S. 528, 534\\n\\n(1973).\\n\\n          Defendants respond that the Court cannot probe \\u201cgovernment officials\\u2019 subjective\\n\\nintentions.\\u201d Dkt. 38 at 27. True, the Court cannot read minds. But it can read. EO14183 and\\n\\nthe Hegseth Policy tag transgender persons as weak, dishonorable, undisciplined, boastful,\\n\\nselfish liars who are mentally and physically unfit to serve.28 Its accompanying Fact Sheet piles\\n\\non, further calling transgender persons insane, not resilient, unhealthy, and unfit. Dkt. Notice\\n\\n(Mar. 7, 2025). Hardly subtle. Refusing to give up the ghost, however, Defendants refused to\\n\\nanswer whether this language evinces animus. Tr. (Feb. 18, 2025) at 155\\u201356; see also id. at\\n\\n154\\u201359; Tr. (Mar. 12, 2025) at 192. But the Court has no such problem. It finds that the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n28\\n  The Court reaches this conclusion by mirroring the Ban\\u2019s language. For example, in stating\\nthat transgender persons cannot maintain discipline, the Ban necessarily asserts that transgender\\npersons are undisciplined.\\n\\n                                                   65\\n\\fMilitary Ban\\u2019s language evinces the \\u201cbare\\u2026desire to harm a politically unpopular group.\\u201d\\n\\nMoreno, 413 U.S. at 534.\\n\\n          Faced with incontrovertible facts, Defendants do not contend that the Military Ban is an\\n\\nanimus-free zone. They argue instead that the Military Ban must be impossible to justify based\\n\\non anything but animus to be unconstitutional. Tr. (Feb. 19, 2025) at 63\\u201364, 87. \\u201cIf,\\u201d\\n\\nDefendants claim, \\u201cthere is a facially legitimate, bona fide reason, then perceived animus is not a\\n\\nground on which the courts can second-guess the political branches in the national security\\n\\nspace.\\u201d Id. at 90. Defendants have not provided a legitimate reason for banning all transgender\\n\\ntroops.\\n\\n          That aside, animus alone has never been the standard. The Colorado law at issue in\\n\\nRomer, for example, prohibited the state or any municipalities from enacting laws designed to\\n\\nprotect members of the LBGTQ community. 517 U.S. at 624. The state offered a legitimate,\\n\\nbona-fide reason for the law: \\u201crespect for other citizens\\u2019 freedom of association.\\u201d Id. at 635.\\n\\nNonetheless, because the \\u201cbreadth of the amendment [wa]s so far removed from these particular\\n\\njustifications,\\u201d the Supreme Court \\u201cf[ou]nd it impossible to credit them.\\u201d Id. Thus, even though\\n\\nthe state alleged a legitimate interest, the Court held that the law \\u201cclassifie[d] homosexuals not to\\n\\nfurther a proper legislative end but to make them unequal to everyone else.\\u201d Id. The Military\\n\\nBan does the same.\\n\\n          The Military Ban is also unique in its unadulterated expression of animus\\u2014an expression\\n\\nof animus that no law the Supreme Court has struck down comes close to matching. Though the\\n\\nlaw at issue in Romer directly addressed \\u201chomosexuals,\\u201d it did not include any demeaning or\\n\\nderogatory language. Id. at 624. In Cleburne, a Texas city required a special permit for\\n\\n\\u201chospitals for the insane or feeble-minded,\\u201d but the zoning ordinance said nothing about the\\n\\n\\n                                                  66\\n\\fcharacter of mentally ill persons. 473 U.S. at 436. The provision at issue in Moreno, which\\n\\ninvolved a challenge to a food stamp restriction aimed at hippies, required only that food stamp\\n\\nrecipients living in the same household be related. 413 U.S. at 531. Even the Defense of\\n\\nMarriage Act was silent as to any negative stereotypes or generalizations about gay people.\\n\\nWindsor, 570 U.S. at 752. Yet the Supreme Court struck down each of these laws.\\n\\n         Defendants also argue that once the government identifies a legitimate interest, a court\\u2019s\\n\\ninquiry stops. Tr. (Feb. 18, 2025) at 158\\u201359; Tr. (Feb. 19, 2025) at 63\\u201364. Not so. The city in\\n\\nCleburne argued that the special permit requirement was related to its interest in \\u201cthe safety and\\n\\nfears of residents in the adjoining neighborhood.\\u201d 473 U.S. at 437. These safety concerns were\\n\\nnot entirely unfounded\\u2014the city was worried about \\u201cnegative attitudes\\u201d of local property\\n\\nowners, the location of the mental institution near a school, fire hazards, and traffic congestion.\\n\\nId. at 448\\u201350. But the Supreme Court did not simply take the city at its word. Instead, it found\\n\\nthat these rationales \\u201cfail[ed] rationally to justify\\u201d the special permit restriction. Id. at 450.\\n\\n        The Moreno Court scrutinized the government\\u2019s stated interest even further. The\\n\\ngovernment maintained that the food stamps restriction was meant to minimize fraud. Moreno,\\n\\n413 U.S. at 535. But the Supreme Court noted that there were already provisions in place to\\n\\nminimize fraud, and whatever fraud did occur was subject to criminal prosecution. Id. at 536.\\n\\nThus the Court had \\u201cconsiderable doubt\\u201d that the restriction was \\u201crationally . . . intended to\\n\\nprevent those very same abuses.\\u201d Id. at 537.\\n\\n        Peeling back other stated rationales of the Military Ban reveals pretext for animus. To\\n\\nstart, Defendants concede that DoD has never identified any \\u201cmental health constraint\\u201d other\\n\\nthan gender dysphoria that is wholly inconsistent with characterizations such as \\u201chonesty,\\n\\nhumility, and integrity\\u201d and therefore with military service. Dkt. 66 at 3. Moreover, current\\n\\n\\n                                                   67\\n\\fmilitary policies already address gender dysphoria. See Dkt. 72-67 (DoDI 6130.03, Vol. 2);\\n\\nDoDI 6130.03, Vol. 1 at 6.28(t). If gender dysphoria were a genuine concern, the Policy would\\n\\ncover a narrow set of individuals with gender dysphoria. Instead, the Policy reaches everyone\\n\\nwho has ever \\u201cexhibit[ed] symptoms consistent with[] gender dysphoria.\\u201d Hegseth Policy at 3.\\n\\nBecause this \\u201cbreadth\\u201d is \\u201cso far removed\\u201d from military health concerns, it is \\u201cimpossible to\\n\\ncredit\\u201d Defendants\\u2019 justifications. Romer, 517 U.S. at 635.\\n\\n       Defendants claim more generally that the Ban is needed because every servicemember\\n\\nmust meet the military\\u2019s rigorous physical and mental fitness requirements. See Dkt. 72-67; Dkt.\\n\\n72-82 \\u00b6 20. But such standards are already in place, and each active-duty Plaintiff already meets\\n\\nthem. See, e.g., Dkt. 72-27 \\u00b6 4 (\\u201cI meet all standards applicable to male service members.\\u201d);\\n\\nDkt. 72-58 \\u00b6 18 (\\u201cI meet all standards applicable to female service members.\\u201d); Defs.\\n\\nConcession, Tr. (Mar. 12, 2025) at 130. And if the concern were genuine, the Policy would\\n\\npermit waivers for anyone who could demonstrate an \\u201cability to safely complete common\\n\\nmilitary tasks at a general duty level.\\u201d DoDI 6130.03, Vol. 2, at 3.2(a). Or, to use the Policy\\u2019s\\n\\nown language, it would allow for waivers \\u201cprovided there is a compelling Government interest in\\n\\nretaining the Service member that directly supports warfighting capabilities.\\u201d See Hegseth\\n\\nPolicy at 4. So, like in Moreno, the Court has \\u201cconsiderable doubt\\u201d that this rationale is driving\\n\\nthe Military Ban.\\n\\n       If the fitness concern were genuine, the Policy would also be limited to addressing health\\n\\nconcerns. Yet the policy makes some assertions that can be explained only by pretext, e.g., that\\n\\npronoun usage in some (still unfathomable) way impacts military readiness. Id. at 3. Defendants\\n\\nalso make a passing reference that the military must address suicide ideation. Fair, but again, the\\n\\nmilitary already bars individuals with suicidality from enlisting. See DoDI 6130.03, Vol. 1, at\\n\\n\\n                                                68\\n\\f6.28(m). Additionally, if the health concern were genuine, the Policy would apply to all people\\n\\nwho have received any kind of hormone therapy or genital reconstruction surgery. But it does\\n\\nnot. It applies only to those who have received such care \\u201cas treatment for gender dysphoria or\\n\\nin pursuit of a sex transition.\\u201d Hegseth Policy at 6; see also Defs. Concession, Tr. (Mar. 12,\\n\\n2025) at 120.\\n\\n           Defendants claim the Military Ban is necessary to ensure all servicemembers\\u2019 privacy,\\n\\nsuch as in sleeping and showering arrangements. See Hegseth Policy at 4. If this concern were\\n\\ngenuine, barrack assignments would be based on anatomical (phenotypic) sex, not reproductive\\n\\n(gonadal) sex. For intersex individuals, who can present in about forty different ways,29 the two\\n\\nare not necessarily aligned. A person with ovotestes has both ovarian and testicular tissue and so\\n\\npresumably could not be assigned to either male or female barracks, regardless of their\\n\\nanatomical sex.30 A person with male genitalia but female reproductive anatomy would be put in\\n\\nfemale barracks, undoing the very privacy concern the Military Ban purports to address.31 And\\n\\nhow will the military assure persons are tucked away in barracks without causing \\u201cprivacy\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n29\\n   The Cleveland Clinic\\u2019s intersex internet page addresses some of these presentations. Intersex,\\nCleveland Clinic (last visited Mar. 16, 2025),\\nhttps://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/16324-intersex.\\n30\\n     Id.\\n31\\n  To be sure, being intersex is rare\\u2014about 1.7% of the U.S. adult population. But then again,\\nbeing transgender is more so\\u2014about 0.6% of the U.S. adult population. See Rebecca Boone &\\nJeff McMillan, How many transgender and intersex people live in the U.S.?, US News (July 27,\\n2023, 10:31 AM), https://apnews.com/article/how-many-transgender-intersex-laws-\\n0218b75a197f07d8c51620bb73495d55.\\n\\n                                                  69\\n\\fconcerns? Presumably, by looking at them. So why not base barrack assignments on anatomical\\n\\nsex? Because doing so would not exclude transgender persons from serving.32\\n\\n       Lastly, Defendants\\u2019 cost concerns make clear that the Ban is purposely targeting\\n\\ntransgender individuals. As discussed, the cost of medical care for transgender troops is de\\n\\nminimis. See supra Findings of Fact II.B.4. And Defendants have not explained why these costs\\n\\nare of more concern than other costs. \\u201cMany service members receive medical care for far more\\n\\ncommon medical conditions, at a far greater cost and with a significant impact on the military\\n\\nbudget.\\u201d Dkt. 72-76 \\u00b6 13. For example, Viagra cost the DoD $41,000,000 in 2023 alone\\u2014\\n\\nnearly eight times what the DoD spends on transgender medical care each year. See Dkt. 72-68\\n\\n\\u00b6 9. Additionally, \\u201cthe same medications (hormone therapies) and surgeries (mastectomies,\\n\\nhysterectomies, genital reconstruction)\\u201d that Defendants claim are too costly \\u201care provided to\\n\\nnon-transgender service members.\\u201d Dkt. 72-78 \\u00b6 65. But the Hegseth Policy does not ban those\\n\\ntreatments. So why pay for hormone therapy for some servicemembers but not others? Because\\n\\nthe Policy clearly targets transgender medical care costs. It \\u201crest[s] on irrational prejudice.\\u201d\\n\\nCleburne, 473 U.S. at 450.\\n\\n               2.     Defendants Misread Trump v. Hawaii Again\\n\\n       Defendants rely on Trump v. Hawaii to argue that the Court must defer to the military\\n\\neven if it finds the military ban is fueled by animus. They assert that because the government\\n\\nhas offered what\\u2014on their face\\u2014appear to be legitimate reasons for the ban (i.e., troop\\n\\nreadiness and unit cohesion), the Court must uphold the Ban. Opp. at 50\\u201354.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n32\\n   Courts have rejected privacy as a rationale for discrimination against transgender persons. See\\nA.C. v. Metro. Sch. Dist. of Martinsville, 75 F.4th 760, 772\\u201373 (7th Cir. 2023); Grimm, 972 F.3d\\nat 613\\u201314; Parents for Privacy v. Barr, 949 F.3d 1210, 1225 (9th Cir. 2020); Doe ex rel. Doe v.\\nBoyertown Area Sch. Dist., 897 F.3d 518, 531 (3d Cir. 2018).\\n                                                 70\\n\\f         As discussed above, this has never been the Supreme Court\\u2019s approach in animus cases.\\n\\nThe Hawaii Court cited Moreno, Cleburne, and Romer as examples of laws that could not\\n\\n\\u201creasonably be understood to result from a justification independent of unconstitutional\\n\\ngrounds.\\u201d Hawaii, 585 U.S. at 705, 706. Yet the defendants in those cases did not fail to proffer\\n\\nindependent justifications. Rather, the Supreme Court found those purported justifications to be\\n\\nlacking. See supra Analysis II.C.1. So, too, does this Court find Defendants\\u2019 justifications\\n\\nempty.\\n\\n         Defendants further argue that, to find animus, the Hawaii Court required that a law be\\n\\n\\u201cinexplicable by anything but animus.\\u201d Opp. at 51 (quoting Hawaii, 585 U.S. at 706). But this\\n\\nquote is inapposite for two reasons. First, this is not what the Supreme Court said. Rather, it\\n\\nconcluded that the entry restriction proclamation \\u201cd[id] not fit the pattern\\u201d of previous animus\\n\\ncases because it was neither \\u201cimpossible to discern a relationship to legitimate state interests\\u201d nor\\n\\nwas it \\u201cinexplicable by anything but animus.\\u201d Hawaii, 585 U.S. at 706 (cleaned up). Thus, at\\n\\nthe very least, the Hawaii Court offered two paths to a finding of animus: the lack of a\\n\\nrelationship to a legitimate state interest or the inability to explain by anything but animus. Id.\\n\\nThis Court, as discussed above, cannot conclude that the Military Ban is related to the\\n\\ngovernment\\u2019s interests in military readiness, unit cohesion, and cost reduction. So, applying the\\n\\nHawaii Court\\u2019s own language, Defendants\\u2019 argument fails.\\n\\n         Second, even if a law had to be inexplicable by anything but animus, the Court here has\\n\\nno trouble finding that the Military Ban fits this description. To recap, the Military Ban:\\n\\ndisqualifies all \\u201c[t]ransgender troops . . . without an exemption\\u201d; contains an exemption in name\\n\\nonly; relies on derogatory generalizations Defendants concede are pure conjecture; reflects no\\n\\nstudy of the service of transgender persons since 2021 and instead relies on \\u201cpredictions\\u201d made\\n\\n\\n                                                 71\\n\\fin 2018; egregiously misquotes studies and ignores data supporting service by transgender\\n\\npersons; asserts \\u201cjustifications\\u201d untethered to fact except insofar as Defendants\\u2019 own evidence\\n\\ncontradicts them; and bans certain medical treatments only when prescribed to transgender\\n\\nindividuals. The Court could go on. Suffice it to say, at this early stage, Plaintiffs are likely to\\n\\nprevail on their claim that the Military Ban is driven exclusively by animus.\\n\\n                  3.    The Government Has Targeted Transgender Persons Writ Large\\n\\n          The Court could stop here in its analysis and comfortably conclude that Plaintiffs are\\n\\nlikely to succeed on their claim that the Military Ban is motivated by animus and is not tailored\\n\\nto meet its stated goals. But, as they say, there is more, for the Military Ban does not stand\\n\\nalone. President Trump has signed an executive order recognizing the existence of only two\\n\\nsexes;33 blocked schools from using federal funds to promote the idea that gender can be fluid;34\\n\\ndirected the State Department to stop issuing documents that allow a third \\u201cX\\u201d gender marker;35\\n\\nchanged references to \\u201cLGBTQI+\\u201d on government websites to \\u201cLGB,\\u201d erasing not just\\n\\ntransgender persons, but intersex people as well;36 revoked the ability of transgender federal\\n\\nemployees to receive gender-affirming care;37 and directed that all incarcerated transgender\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n33\\n     Exec.

THE BALANCE OF THE EQUITIES AND PUBLIC INTEREST FAVOR\\n             PLAINTIFFS\\n\\n          The final two factors\\u2014the balance of equities and the public interest\\u2014favor Plaintiffs.\\n\\nThe balance of equities weighs the harm to plaintiffs absent a preliminary injunction against the\\n\\nharm to defendants if the court grants the motion. Pursuing Am.\\u2019s Greatness v. FEC, 831 F.3d\\n\\n500, 511 (D.C. Cir. 2016). When the government is a party to the case, as it is here, this\\n\\nbalancing test and the public interest merge into one factor. Id. (\\u201cthe government\\u2019s interest is the\\n\\npublic interest\\u201d).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                  75\\n\\f       Defendants will not suffer any harm if this Court grants the preliminary injunction. In\\n\\nWinter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., the Supreme Court emphasized the deference\\n\\nafforded to the judgment of military officials \\u201cconcerning the relative importance of a particular\\n\\nmilitary interest.\\u201d Winter, 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008) (cleaned up). In finding that the balance of\\n\\nequities and consideration of the public interest \\u201ctip[ped] strongly in favor of the Navy,\\u201d the\\n\\nCourt gave significant weight to officers\\u2019 statements regarding the burden a preliminary\\n\\ninjunction would place on the Navy\\u2019s ability to conduct training exercises and the resulting\\n\\nadverse impact on national security. Id. at 24\\u201326.\\n\\n       Defendants have provided no testimony. That is so most likely because no such burden\\n\\nexists here. Granting the preliminary injunction would maintain the status quo of policies that\\n\\nhave governed the military for years. See Dkt. 72-1 at 12\\u201315, 28. The accession policy has been\\n\\nin place since 2021, id. at 14\\u201315, and the retention policy has been in place for nearly a decade\\n\\n(though it was interrupted by the first Trump Administration\\u2019s Mattis Plan), id. at 2\\u20136, 28. The\\n\\nMilitary Ban does not cite, and Defendants have not provided, any studies or declarations that\\n\\nexplain why maintaining the status quo pending litigation would unfairly burden the military.\\n\\n       In contrast, Plaintiffs will be subject to the irreparable harm discussed above absent a\\n\\npreliminary injunction. And absent one, Plaintiffs will also face significant hardship because the\\n\\nMilitary Ban puts to them a Hobson\\u2019s choice46: either immediately conform with the grooming\\n\\nand appearance standards for their birth sex or choose separation, either voluntarily or by\\n\\nremoval proceedings. Dkt. 72-1 at 74. Since Plaintiffs cannot physically conform to those\\n\\n\\n46\\n   A \\u201cHobson\\u2019s choice\\u201d is a free choice in which there is only one real option. The term traces\\nits origin to Thomas Hobson, a sixteenth-century English stable owner who notoriously offered\\nhis customers a \\u201cchoice\\u201d of taking the horse closest to the door (so all would get equally used) or\\nleaving without a horse\\u2014essentially, no choice for those who needed a horse. See H.W. Fowler,\\nHobson\\u2019s Choice, in The King\\u2019s English 203 (2d ed. 1908).\\n\\n                                                 76\\n\\fstandards and would have to do so against medical advice even if they could, they have no\\n\\nchoice but to separate. See, e.g., Dkts. 72-19 \\u00b6 8; 72-22 \\u00b6 6; 72-24 \\u00b6 6. This then puts to\\n\\nPlaintiffs a Sophie\\u2019s choice.47 If they separate voluntarily, they will leave a career that they have\\n\\nno desire to end. If they opt for removal proceedings, they may be discharged dishonorably and,\\n\\nper the Hegseth Policy, will be required to repay the military their bonuses and other amounts.\\n\\nHegseth Policy at 7; Dkt. 79-1 at 7. Permitting the Hegseth Policy to remain in place during\\n\\nlitigation, therefore, will work an obvious hardship to the Plaintiffs.\\n\\n       Public interest considerations also support granting the preliminary injunction. For one\\n\\nthing, \\u201c[e]nforcement of an unconstitutional law is always contrary to the public interest.\\u201d\\n\\nGordon v. Holder, 721 F.3d 638, 653 (D.C. Cir. 2013). As discussed above, Plaintiffs have\\n\\nshown they are likely to succeed on their Fifth Amendment claim. And Plaintiffs point to\\n\\npotential harm to military cohesion and capability should the ban go into effect. Dkt. 72-1 at 75.\\n\\n       Plaintiffs have carried their burden under all four preliminary injunction factors by\\n\\nshowing their likely success on the merits, the threat of irreparable harm, and that the public\\n\\ninterest and equities support an injunction.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n47\\n  A \\u201cSophie\\u2019s choice\\u201d is a dilemma between two equally devastating options. In the novel\\nSophie\\u2019s Choice, a camp doctor at Auschwitz makes Sophie choose which of her two children\\nwould be gassed and which would live. Sophie chooses to save her son, Jan, so that the family\\nname can continue through him. She releases her daughter, Eva, and watches as she is taken\\naway to be killed in a gas chamber. Sophie, unable to live with the guilt, later commits suicide.\\nSee William Styron, Sophie\\u2019s Choice (Random House 1979). So, not a pick-me-up.\\n\\n\\n                                                 77\\n\\f                               SCOPE OF THE INJUNCTION\\n\\n       Considering the full Record and for the reasons stated above, the Court hereby GRANTS\\n\\nPlaintiffs\\u2019 Renewed Application for Preliminary Injunction. The Court details the scope of the\\n\\ninjunction in the Order that accompanies this Opinion. On its own motion, the Court stays this\\n\\ninjunction until March 21, 2025, at 10:00 am eastern, to provide Defendants time to consider\\n\\nfiling a motion for an emergency stay in the D.C. Circuit.\\n\\n       Defendants claim that any injunction must be limited to the Plaintiffs. Opp. at 61. It\\n\\ncannot be, rationally or logistically. Other transgender servicemembers face the same irreparable\\n\\nharms as Plaintiffs. Any transgender person affected by the Ban would need only to file a \\u201cme\\n\\ntoo\\u201d complaint in this Court to obtain the same relief. The Court and Defendants then would\\n\\nhave to deal with a never-ending conveyor belt of claims. A limited injunction would also cause\\n\\nhavoc for the Armed Forces. Some transgender persons would be permitted to serve and accede,\\n\\nothers would not. Depending on what happened at the permanent injunction phase, one group or\\n\\nthe other would be affected. Superiors and colleagues would need to keep track of ongoing\\n\\nlitigation docket updates to understand who was covered. Notably, the government has\\n\\nreiterated that \\u201cuniformity\\u201d is one of the key goals of the Military Ban multiple times throughout\\n\\nthis litigation. See EO14183 \\u00a7 2; Hegseth Policy at 3; Action Memo at 2.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                78\\n\\f                                          CONCLUSION\\n\\n          The Court knows that this opinion will lead to heated public debate and appeals. In a\\n\\nhealthy democracy, both are positive outcomes. We should all agree, however, that every person\\n\\nwho has answered the call to serve deserves our gratitude and respect. For, as Elmer Davis\\n\\nobserved, \\u201c[t]his nation will remain the land of the free only so long as it is the home of the\\n\\nbrave.\\u201d\\n\\n          The Court extends its appreciation to every current servicemember and veteran.

The President issued EO14183 within seven days of taking office, and\\n\\nSecretary Hegseth issued the Policy thirty days later. There is no evidence that they consulted\\n\\nwith uniformed military leaders before doing so. Neither document contains any analysis nor\\n\\ncites any data.

Who considered\\n\\nthe information, however, is anyone\\u2019s guess; Defendants do not know. Maybe no one, because\\n\\none study is eight years old and the other two support Plaintiffs\\u2019 position.\\n\\n       Transgender persons have served openly since 2021, but Defendants have not analyzed\\n\\ntheir service. That is unfortunate. Plaintiffs\\u2019 service records alone are Exhibit A for the\\n\\nproposition that transgender persons can have the warrior ethos, physical and mental health,\\n\\nselflessness, honor, integrity, and discipline to ensure military excellence. Defendants agree.\\n\\nThey agree that Plaintiffs are mentally and physically fit to serve, have \\u201cserved honorably,\\u201d and\\n\\n\\u201chave satisfied the rigorous standards\\u201d demanded of them. Tr. (Feb. 18, 2025) at 9\\u201314, 148; see\\n\\nalso Tr. (Mar. 12, 2025) at 130. Plaintiffs, they acknowledge, have \\u201cmade America safer.\\u201d Tr.\\n\\n(Feb. 18, 2025) at 10. So why discharge them and other decorated soldiers? Crickets from\\n\\nDefendants on this key question.\\n\\n       Plaintiffs have also introduced declarations from the military leaders responsible for\\n\\nintegrating transgender persons into open military service. Each declarant attests that our\\n\\nmilitary has not fallen into an \\u201cexistential\\u201d crisis since transgender persons began serving openly\\n\\n                                                 4\\n\\fin 2021. Nor have our \\u201clethal and effective\\u201d soldiers come unglued when asked to use preferred\\n\\npronouns, which the Hegseth Policy also bans. To the contrary, they each testify that recruiting,\\n\\nunit cohesion, and military readiness have improved since 2021.\\n\\n       To obtain an injunction, Plaintiffs must establish a likelihood of success on the merits.\\n\\nThey have done so. The Court\\u2019s factual findings, the vast majority conceded by Defendants and\\n\\nall supported by the Record, make it highly unlikely that the Military Ban will survive judicial\\n\\nreview, whether it be rational basis or intermediate scrutiny. Plaintiffs must also show\\n\\nirreparable harm and that the balance of the equities and the public interest favor an injunction.\\n\\nOn the former, Plaintiffs face a violation of their constitutional rights, which constitutes\\n\\nirreparable harm. Indeed, the cruel irony is that thousands of transgender servicemembers have\\n\\nsacrificed\\u2014some risking their lives\\u2014to ensure for others the very equal protection rights the\\n\\nMilitary Ban seeks to deny them. On the latter, Defendants have not shown they will be\\n\\nburdened by continuing the status quo pending this litigation, and avoiding constitutional\\n\\nviolations is always in the public interest.\\n\\n       The Court therefore GRANTS Plaintiffs\\u2019 Renewed Application for Preliminary\\n\\nInjunction. Dkt. 72. The Court details the scope of the injunction in the Order that accompanies\\n\\nthis Opinion. The Court, on its own motion, stays its Order until March 21, 2025, at 10:00 am\\n\\neastern, to provide Defendants time to consider filing an emergency stay with the D.C. Circuit.\\n\\n                                               *****\\n\\n       The Court does not issue this preliminary injunction lightly. Judicial overreach is no less\\n\\npernicious than executive overreach. But the coordinate branches must, \\u201cby their mutual\\n\\nrelations, be the means of keeping each other in their proper places.\\u201d The Federalist No. 51\\n\\n(James Madison). The President and Defendants could have crafted a policy that balances the\\n\\n\\n                                                  5\\n\\fNation\\u2019s need for a prepared military and Americans\\u2019 right to equal protection. They still can.\\n\\nThe Military Ban, however, is not that policy. The Court therefore must act to uphold the equal\\n\\nprotection rights that the military defends every day.\\n\\n       The Court\\u2019s opinion is long, but its premise is simple. In the self-evident truth that \\u201call\\n\\npeople are created equal,\\u201d5 all means all. Nothing more.

THE HEGSETH POLICY BANS ALL TRANSGENDER TROOPS\\n\\n       Secretary Hegseth issued the Hegseth Policy on February 26, 2025. Dkt. 63-1. The next\\n\\nday, the Department of Defense and Secretary Hegseth publicly announced that under it:\\n\\n\\u201cTransgender troops are disqualified from service without an exemption.\\u201d16 Defense counsel\\n\\ncontends that the Court must ignore Secretary Hegseth\\u2019s public description of the policy he\\n\\nwrote and that he is responsible for implementing. Tr. (Mar. 12, 2025) at 19\\u201322. Secretary\\n\\nHegseth used the word \\u201ctransgender,\\u201d defense counsel claims, only as \\u201cshorthand\\u201d for gender\\n\\ndysphoria. Id. at 22. Seriously? These were not off-the-cuff remarks at a cocktail party. DoD\\n\\nand Secretary Hegseth used official government accounts to announce a new policy affecting the\\n\\nentire U.S. Military. The Court presumes that in doing so they did not use loose or misleading\\n\\nlanguage. Indeed, if the Hegseth Policy addressed only gender dysphoria, the post would have\\n\\nread, \\u201cGender dysphoria is a disqualifying medical condition for service.\\u201d Both sentences\\n\\ncontain nine words, belying counsel\\u2019s \\u201cshorthand\\u201d excuse.\\n\\n       DoD and Secretary Hegseth announced that the Policy bans \\u201ctransgender troops\\u201d because\\n\\nthat is precisely what it does.

The Action Memo, an internal document\\n\\naccompanying the Hegseth Policy, explains that the Military Ban \\u201cwas informed through\\n\\nconsideration of, among other things,\\u201d EO14183, the Hegseth Policy, and the following: (1) the\\n\\n\\u201cSecDef Memorandum\\u201d from February 22, 2018 (i.e., the Mattis Policy); (2) \\u201ca 2021 review\\n\\nconducted by . . . the Accession Medical Standards Analysis and Research Activity,\\u201d (AMSARA\\n\\nReport), (3) \\u201c[a] 2025 medical literature review,\\u201d (Medical Literature Review), and (4) \\u201ca review\\n\\nof cost data.\\u201d Action Memo at 4\\u20135.\\n\\n       After listing the sources the Military Ban relies on, the Action Memo concludes that\\n\\n                [w]hile Service members with gender dysphoria volunteered to\\n                serve their country, the costs associated with their health care,\\n                coupled with the medical and readiness risks associated with their\\n                diagnosis and associated treatment that can limit their\\n                deployability, make continued service by such individuals\\n                incompatible with the Department\\u2019s rigorous standards and\\n                national security imperative to deliver a ready, deployable force.\\n\\n\\n18\\n  Mr. Skelly claims that the Hegseth Policy is \\u201cboth punitive and based on animus.\\u201d Dkt. 72-73\\n\\u00b6 3.

Dkt. 73-24. The Center studied medical\\n\\nissues relating to accession of persons with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria. The\\n\\nCenter compared the available accessions records of transgender service persons to a cohort of\\n\\nother servicemembers. Id. at 5.\\n\\n       The Action Memo\\u2019s entire discussion of the AMSARA Report is:\\n\\n               A 2021 review conducted by DoD\\u2019s [AMSARA team] found that \\u201crates of\\n               disability evaluation were estimated to be higher [about 12%] among\\n               [transgender] service members [1%]. Additionally, this review found that\\n               nearly 40% of Service members with gender dysphoria in an observed\\n               cohort were non-deployable over a 24 month period. This level of non-\\n               deployability creates significant readiness risk and places additional\\n               burdens on Service members without gender dysphoria to meet\\n               requirements.\\n\\nAction Memo at 4 (emphasis added).\\n\\n       No one who has read the AMSARA Report could find that it supports this conclusion.\\n\\nTo start, the Action Memo fails to mention the Report\\u2019s key finding: rates of transgender persons\\n\\nexperiencing the conditions of the cohort group (psychiatric, musculoskeletal, and neurological)\\n\\n\\u201cwere comparable to those of all service members evaluated for disability.\\u201d Dkt. 73-24 at 6\\n\\n                                                25\\n\\f(emphasis added). The other rates the Center studied were \\u201csimilar\\u201d between the transgender\\n\\ncohort and the other servicemember cohort as to: (1) the proportion with history of any accession\\n\\nmedical disqualification status; (2) the distribution of specific medical disqualifications; (3) the\\n\\nrates of adverse attrition; and (4) the rates of existing prior to service discharge. Id. at 4. The\\n\\nAction Memo quotes the only rate that was higher for transgender persons, and that was a rate of\\n\\nevaluation, not occurrence. Action Memo at 4.\\n\\n       With respect to non-deployability, the Action Memo also ignores that \\u201cdata w[as] not\\n\\navailable from non-transgender service members that could serve as a basis for comparison to\\n\\nindicate if supposed non-deployability rates amongst the transgender cohorts differed from the\\n\\noverall non-deployability rate.\\u201d Dkt. 86-1 (AMSARA Parts I-III) at 11\\u201312. Without comparator\\n\\ndata, the non-deployability rate for the transgender cohort is not informative, something the\\n\\nReport highlights. Dkt. 73-24 at 6.\\n\\n       The Center also conducted a medical literature review as part of its work that the Action\\n\\nMemo ignores altogether. One study stands out. The AMSARA Report cited, without criticism,\\n\\na 2014 study that summarized \\u201cand challenge[d] [] common notions to justify barring\\n\\ntransgender individuals from Service which are actually not supported by research and not\\n\\ninternally consistent with other DoD policies.\\u201d Dkt. 86-1 at 2. \\u201cThe most notable challenge to\\n\\nthese assumptions is falsely equating transgender identify with mental health disorders, which\\n\\nhas become a debunked connection broadly in the field.\\u201d Id.\\n\\n       The Court does not question military judgment broadly as to acceptable non-deployment\\n\\nrates. The Court instead finds that the Action Memo\\u2019s summary of the AMSARA Report is\\n\\ninexplicably misleading. Further, the Report contradicts, rather than supports, the conclusions\\n\\nthe Action Memo draws from it. These findings support Plaintiffs\\u2019 contention that Defendants\\n\\n\\n                                                  26\\n\\fdid not exercise military judgment to which the Court can defer on the narrow question of\\n\\nwhether the Hegseth Policy comports with the Fifth Amendment.\\n\\n               3.     2025 Medical Literature Review\\n\\n       The Action Memo also references the 2025 Medical Literature Review conducted by the\\n\\nOffice of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs. The Action Memo\\u2019s entire\\n\\ndiscussion of the Medical Literature Review is that it:\\n\\n               Included findings that \\u201c55% of transgender individuals\\n               experienced suicidal ideation and 29% attempted suicide in their\\n               lifetime...[and] the suicide attempt rate is estimated to be 13 times\\n               higher among transgender individuals compared to their cisgender\\n               counterparts,\\u201d \\u201ctransgender individuals are approximately twice as\\n               likely to receive a psychiatric diagnosis compared to cisgender\\n               individuals,\\u201d and that the strength of the evidence on transgender\\n               mental health and gender-affirming care is low to moderate.\\n\\nAction Memo at 4\\u20135 (quoting Dkt. 73-25 (Med. Lit. Rev.) at 2\\u20133).\\n\\n       No one summarizing the Review in good faith could draw these conclusions. To start,\\n\\nthe Medical Literature Review did not survey studies on transgender persons in military service:\\n\\ni.e., individuals already found to be physically and mentally fit. Dkt. 73-25 at 2; see also Defs.\\n\\nConcession, Tr. (Mar. 12, 2025) at 116\\u201317. So it can shed little light on how transgender\\n\\npersons fare in the military. See also Defs. Concession, Tr. (Mar. 12, 2025) at 117. For that\\n\\nanalysis, the Court refers to the AMSARA Report, which, again, found similar rates of\\n\\npsychotherapy for transgender and other servicemembers.\\n\\n       Second, the suicide conclusions of the Medical Literature Review undercut banning\\n\\ntransgender persons from the military. To start, the military already restricts individuals with\\n\\nsuicidal tendencies from enlisting. See DoDI 6130.03, Vol. 1, at 6.28(m). Moreover, the studies\\n\\nunder review confirm that transgender persons are not inherently mentally unfit. Instead, the\\n\\nstudies cited find that transgender suicide rates are influenced by external factors, such as\\n\\n                                                 27\\n\\f\\u201cgender identity-related disparities, discrimination, lack of family and social support, barriers to\\n\\ngender-affirming care, co-occurring mental health conditions, economic instability, and\\n\\nexperiences of violence and victimization.\\u201d Dkt. 73-25 at 3. The studies also show \\u201cthat suicide\\n\\nrisk among transgender . . . individuals is mitigated by access to gender-affirming care, strong\\n\\nsocial and family support, legal and social recognition, affirming mental health services,\\n\\ncommunity connectedness, and protections against discrimination.\\u201d Id.; see also Defs.\\n\\nConcession, Tr. (Mar. 12, 2025) at 118\\u201319.\\n\\n       Third, each meta-study cited found that Gender-Affirming Hormone Treatment and\\n\\nGender-Affirming Surgery treatment improves psychological well-being, mental health, and\\n\\nquality of life. See id. at 4\\u20136. Each treatment method reduces gender dysphoria, depression,\\n\\nanxiety, psychological distress, and depressive symptoms. Id. Further, \\u201clong-term studies show\\n\\nthat regret rates are extremely low, with most individuals reporting improved quality of life,\\n\\nbody image satisfaction, and overall well-being.\\u201d Id. at 5.\\n\\n       The Court does not question military judgment as to what constitutes as disqualifying\\n\\nmedical events. The Court instead finds that the Action Memo\\u2019s summary of the 2025 Medical\\n\\nLiterature Review is inexplicably misleading. Further, the Review contradicts, rather than\\n\\nsupports, the conclusions the Action Memo draw from it. These findings support Plaintiffs\\u2019\\n\\ncontention that Defendants did not exercise military judgment to which the Court can defer on\\n\\nthe narrow question of whether the Hegseth Policy comports with the Fifth Amendment.\\n\\n               4.     Military Costs\\n\\n       The Action Memo concludes that \\u201cthe costs associated with [gender-affirming] health\\n\\ncare,\\u201d which it estimates at $52 million over 10 years, make service by transgender members\\n\\nincompatible with military readiness. Action Memo at 5; Dkt. 66 at 5. It is impossible to see\\n\\n\\n                                                 28\\n\\fhow. Assuming $5.2 million per year, estimated transgender care costs was fifty-seven hundred-\\n\\nthousandths of a percent (00.00057%) of total military spending for 2024.19 Perhaps\\n\\nunderstandably, then, Former Deputy Undersecretary Skelly testified, and Defendants do not\\n\\nrebut, that under the Austin Policy, the Assistant Secretary for Health Affairs or Defense Health\\n\\nAgency staff raised no concerns about the cost of treating transgender servicemembers. See Dkt.\\n\\n72-73 \\u00b6 14; see also Dkt. 72-68 \\u00b6\\u00b6 8\\u20139.\\n\\n       Defendants could fairly respond that whether $5.2 million per year is a \\u201crounding error\\u201d\\n\\nof the overall budget is not the right comparator. Instead, they could argue, the number must be\\n\\ncompared to similar costs the military incurs. Had Defendants done that comparison\\u2014indeed,\\n\\nhad they done any comparison\\u2014they might have a point. But the Action Memo makes no\\n\\ncomparison. See Defs. Concession, Tr. (Mar. 12, 2025) at 144\\u201345. It states that the amount to\\n\\ntreat gender dysphoria is $52 million over ten years and that this amount is too high. Action\\n\\nMemo at 5. Comparisons are important, though. For example, the Department spent\\n\\napproximately $41 million for Viagra in 2023, compared to an estimated $5.2 million for gender-\\n\\naffirming care. See Dkt. 72-68 \\u00b6 9.20 Defendants do not explain why the former (and every\\n\\nother medical cost) is acceptable while the latter requires banning transgender persons from\\n\\nmilitary service. Tr. (Mar. 12, 2025) at 150\\u201354.\\n\\n       Nor do Defendants analyze the costs of discharging and replacing thousands of trained\\n\\nservicemembers, many with decades of experience and specialized skills. This is not an idle\\n\\n\\n\\n19\\n  From January 1, 2016, to May 14, 2021, the military provided gender-affirming care to 1,892\\nactive duty servicemembers. Dkt. 66-1 at 2. That number represents about two hundredths of\\none percent (0.02%) of the 9.5 million beneficiaries TRICARE covered in 2024. See id.\\n20\\n  See also Beyond the Budget: Addressing Financial Accountability in the Department of\\nDefense: Joint Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Nat. Sec., the Border, &amp; Foreign Affairs &amp; the\\nSubcomm. on Gov\\u2019t Operations &amp; the Fed. Workforce, 118th Cong. 49 (2023).\\n                                                29\\n\\fquestion. The military\\u2019s practice of discharging gay and lesbian servicemembers under \\u201cDon\\u2019t\\n\\nAsk, Don\\u2019t Tell\\u201d \\u201ccost taxpayers more than $600 million.\\u201d Dkt. 77-1 at 19 (cleaned up). Even a\\n\\nsixth of that number would be twenty times the annual cost of care for gender dysphoria. Nor do\\n\\nDefendants analyze whether the military could save the same costs, or more, in other areas and\\n\\nwithout excluding a class of people.\\n\\n       The Court does not question military judgment concerning how it should apportion its\\n\\nfunds. Nor does the Court find that the military must undertake an entire budget review before\\n\\nconcluding some costs are unacceptably high. But there must be some benchmark. Citing a\\n\\nnumber\\u2014devoid of any context or analysis\\u2014and concluding that the number is too high does\\n\\nnot support banning transgender persons from military service. If it did, courts would have to\\n\\naccept any cost amount the military cites to justify any policy.\\n\\n               5.     Missing Evidence\\n\\n       If the Military Ban goes into effect, it will upend lives and ruin the careers of thousands\\n\\nof persons. Given this potential impact, the evidence not in the record is striking. Defendants\\n\\nclaim transgender persons impact military readiness, but they acknowledge the DoD does not\\n\\ntrack individuals \\u201cby gender identity and has no means of searching for [the number of]\\n\\n\\u2018transgender individuals.\\u2019\\u201d Dkt. 66 at 5; see also Defs. Concession, Tr. (Mar. 12, 2025) at 173.\\n\\nNot only that, but DoD\\u2019s own Public Affairs Guidance on the Military Ban acknowledges that\\n\\n\\u201c[w]e [DoD] do not have an exact number of active-duty Service members diagnosed with\\n\\ngender dysphoria.\\u201d Dkt. 79-1 at 6.

How many have, like\\n\\nPlaintiffs, served with distinction and are fit for continued service? How many are stable after a\\n\\ngender dysphoria diagnosis? How many have had deployment issues?

Dill, Assistant Secretary of\\n\\nDefense for Manpower and Reserve Affairs, Dkt. 52, to challenge the sworn declaration of\\n\\nGilbert R. Cisneros, Jr., former Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, Dkt.\\n\\n13-30, filed by Plaintiffs. Mr. Cisneros was responsible for overseeing implementation of the\\n\\nAustin Policy and testifies that, \\u201c[i]f there were complaints or problems about transgender\\n\\nservice members, I would have known of them through my role as Under Secretary of Defense\\n\\nfor Personnel and Readiness.\\u201d Dkt. 13-30 \\u00b6\\u00b6 12, 17. He further testifies that \\u201c[i]n that role, I did\\n\\nhear complaints about some other issues, but I never received or heard about a single complaint\\n\\nrelating to transgender service members.\\u201d Id. To rebut this, Mr. Dill testifies that \\u201cit would be\\n\\nhighly unusual for individualized service member complaints regarding unit cohesion, military\\n\\nreadiness, medical readiness, deployability, and lethality to reach the level of the Under\\n\\nSecretary [Mr. Cisneros].\\u201d Dkt. 52-1 \\u00b6 6. In response, Mr. Cisneros testifies that:\\n\\n               [Mr. Dill\\u2019s statement] does not accurately describe my degree of\\n               awareness of these matters as Under Secretary of Defense for\\n               Personnel and Readiness. As the Under Secretary in charge of\\n               readiness, it was my responsibility to be aware of unit cohesion,\\n               military readiness, medical readiness, deployability, and lethality.\\n               If a unit or service was dealing with readiness issues due to the\\n               service by transgender service members, that would have been\\n               brought to my attention.\\n\\n                                                 35\\n\\fDkt. 53-1 \\u00b6 4. Mr. Cisneros provides an example concerning his oversight of Junior ROTC units\\n\\nto support this testimony. Id. \\u00b6 6. As between Mr. Cisneros, who testifies under oath as to his\\n\\nown experience, and Mr. Dill, who testifies under oath as to what he thinks Mr. Cisneros\\u2019s\\n\\npersonal experience would have been, the Court naturally credits Mr. Cisneros. That said, the\\n\\nCourt would reach the same conclusions even if it did not credit this part of Mr. Cisneros\\u2019s\\n\\ntestimony.\\n\\n        Defendants argue generally that the declarants cannot have personal knowledge that \\u201cno\\n\\ncomplaint\\u201d was ever filed concerning a transgender servicemember. Tr. (Feb. 18, 2025) at 124\\u2013\\n\\n26. The Court accepts that contention and will not rely on these declarations for the proposition\\n\\nthat no complaint anywhere in the Armed Forces ever arose. However, as former high-ranking\\n\\nofficials at DoD directly involved in either drafting or implementing the Austin Policy,\\n\\nPlaintiffs\\u2019 declarants have personal knowledge concerning the impact of transgender persons\\n\\nserving openly on military preparedness. And they unanimously conclude that they have had\\n\\neither no detrimental effect or have had a positive one. Defendants concede that they have\\n\\nproffered no evidence to contradict these assertions. Tr. (Feb. 18, 2025) at 120.\\n\\n        The Court, at this early stage of the litigation, accepts Plaintiffs\\u2019 declarants\\u2019 uncontested\\n\\ntestimony as part of its findings of fact.\\n\\n                                    STANDARD OF REVIEW\\n\\n        The \\u201ctraditional goal of a preliminary injunction is to preserve [the] status quo,\\u201d which is\\n\\n\\u201cthe last uncontested status which preceded the pending controversy.\\u201d Huisha-Huisha v.\\n\\nMayorkas, </pre><span class=\\\"citation no-link\\\">27 F.4th 718</span><pre class=\\\"inline\\\">, 733 (D.C.

The second order restricted entry of foreign nationals from six of the original seven\\n\\ncountries, though it allowed waivers on a case-by-case basis. Id. After lower courts again\\n\\nenjoined the order, the Supreme Court stayed the injunctions. Id. at 677.\\n\\n       In September 2017, after the Secretary of Homeland Security completed a review of the\\n\\npolicy, President Trump issued yet another iteration, Proclamation No. 9645. Id. The\\n\\nProclamation implemented entry restrictions for foreign nationals from eight countries \\u201cwhose\\n\\nsystems for managing and sharing information about their nationals the President deemed\\n\\ninadequate.\\u201d Id. Plaintiffs in Trump v.

The Logic of Bostock Applies to the Equal Protection Analysis\\n\\n       In Bostock, the Supreme Court considered whether firing an employee for being\\n\\ntransgender or homosexual constituted sex discrimination. Bostock, 590 U.S. at 650\\u201352. The\\n\\ncase arose under Title VII, which prohibits discrimination \\u201cbecause of . . . sex.\\u201d Id. at 655\\n\\n(quoting 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1)). In holding that firing an employee for being transgender\\n\\ndid in fact constitute sex discrimination, Justice Neil M. Gorsuch asserted that it is \\u201cimpossible\\n\\nto discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating\\n                                                  46\\n\\fagainst that individual based on sex.\\u201d Id. at 660. To illustrate this point, Justice Gorsuch offered\\n\\na hypothetical involving an employer and two employees. See id. The two hypothetical\\n\\nemployees were identical in every way except that one was a transgender woman and the other a\\n\\ncisgender woman. See id. Justice Gorsuch explained that if the hypothetical employer fires only\\n\\nthe transgender woman because she is transgender, it has \\u201cintentionally penalize[d]\\u201d her \\u201cfor\\n\\ntraits or actions that it tolerates in an employee identified as female at birth.\\u201d Id. He concluded\\n\\nthat \\u201cif changing the employee\\u2019s sex would have yielded a different choice by the employer,\\u201d\\n\\nthen the discrimination is based on sex.

The test is simple:\\n\\nwould changing that transgender soldier\\u2019s sex lead to a different decision by the military? Yes, a\\n\\nbiological female who identifies as a woman is not banned. Ergo, discrimination. To adopt\\n\\nJustice Gorsuch\\u2019s analysis to this case:\\n\\n               [T]ake \\u2026 a transgender person [discharged from the military] who\\n               was identified as a male at birth but who now identifies as a\\n               female. If the [military] retains an otherwise identical [soldier]\\n               who was identified as female at birth, the [military] intentionally\\n               penalizes a person identified as male at birth for traits or actions\\n               that it tolerates in [a soldier] identified as female at birth.

They divide their evidence into three categories: (1) military readiness, (2) unit\\n\\ncohesion, good order, and discipline, and (3) disproportionate costs. Below, the Court addresses\\n\\nthe lack of any connection between Defendants\\u2019 evidence and the Military Ban\\u2019s directives. In a\\n\\nseparate section below, see infra Analysis II.C., the Court finds that the Military Ban is littered\\n\\nwith animus and pretext. That discussion is equally applicable in assessing why the Military Ban\\n\\ndoes not survive intermediate scrutiny.\\n\\n                        a.     Military Readiness\\n\\n          Defendants first argue that DoD \\u201cis concerned about subjecting those with a history of\\n\\ngender dysphoria to the unique stresses of military life.\\u201d Opp. at 41. They explain that \\u201cany\\n\\nmental-health condition characterized by clinically significant distress or impairment in\\n                                                 57\\n\\ffunctioning raises readiness concerns.\\u201d Id. And because there is an \\u201cabsence of evidence on the\\n\\nimpact of deployment on individuals with gender dysphoria,\\u201d DoD \\u201cconcluded that this\\n\\ncondition posed readiness risks.\\u201d Id. (cleaned up). Defendants also argue that \\u201cit remains the\\n\\ncase that transition-related medical treatment . . . could render transitioning servicemembers non-\\n\\ndeployable for a potentially significant amount of time,\\u201d which could create \\u201charmful effects on\\n\\ntransitioning servicemembers\\u2019 units as a whole.\\u201d Id. at 42\\u201343 (cleaned up).\\n\\n        To support these conclusions, Defendants \\u201cexpressly relied\\u201d on the 2018 Mattis Policy,\\n\\nthe 2021 AMSARA Report, and the 2025 Medical Literature Review. Opp. at 41\\u201344. Not one\\n\\nof these supports a finding that the discriminatory means employed (banning transgender persons\\n\\nfrom serving) are substantially related to the achievement of the Ban\\u2019s objectives (military\\n\\nreadiness). First, citing the Mattis Policy, Defendants claim that there is an \\u201c\\u2018absence [of\\n\\nexperience] on the impact of deployment on individuals with gender dysphoria.\\u2019\\u201d Id. at 41\\n\\n(quoting Mattis Policy at 39). Therefore, gender dysphoria \\u201cpose[s] readiness risks.\\u201d Id. But\\n\\nthere is no absence. There may have been one in 2018 when the Mattis Policy issued. Since\\n\\nthen, however, persons with gender dysphoria have been deployed under the Austin Policy. See\\n\\nsupra Background III. That Defendants did not review the impact of their service does not mean\\n\\nit does not exist.\\n\\n        Second, the AMSARA Report supports retaining transgender persons in the military. See\\n\\nid. Of the eleven categories it studied, in ten transgender persons\\u2019 statistics were similar to or\\n\\nbetter than those for other servicemembers. Id.; see also Tr. (Mar. 12, 2025) at 78. The Action\\n\\nMemo picked the one outlier: transgender persons are evaluated more. Tr. (Mar. 12, 2025) at 47.\\n\\nBut their occurrence rates, including in psychotherapy and surgery, are similar. Id. at 68.\\n\\nDefendants\\u2019 argument that the Report found that transgender persons\\u2019 non-deployment rates\\n\\n\\n                                                 58\\n\\fwere unacceptable is incorrect. The Report expressly found that more study was needed before\\n\\nanyone could reach such a conclusion because comparator data for other servicemembers had not\\n\\nbeen collected. Dkt. 73-24 at 6.\\n\\n       Third, the 2025 Medical Literature Review does not include studies that address military\\n\\nservicemembers. It therefore does not study the effect of service on active-duty transgender\\n\\nservicemembers, all of whom have met the military\\u2019s mental fitness requirements to accede. See\\n\\nTr. (Mar. 12, 2025) at 130. Indeed, Defendants cite no contemporaneous support for their\\n\\npurported concern that those with a history of gender dysphoria are more prone to the unique\\n\\nstresses of military life. To the contrary, the Review confirms that\\u2014contrary to the presumption\\n\\nthat those who have ever had gender dysphoria cannot serve\\u2014gender dysphoria is highly\\n\\ntreatable. See id.\\n\\n       Plaintiffs, for their part, have provided evidence that disproves any relation between the\\n\\nMilitary Ban\\u2019s methods and goals. Five military leaders in charge of implementing the Austin\\n\\nPolicy each conclude that the Austin Policy was \\u201cbased on years of thoughtful policymaking\\n\\nsupported by peer-reviewed scientific research\\u201d and that it \\u201chas resulted in a stronger, not a\\n\\nweaker military.\\u201d Dkt. 72-69 \\u00b6 34. Based on their first-hand knowledge, they each also testify\\n\\nthat the Austin Policy \\u201cfosters openness and trust among team members, thereby enhancing unit\\n\\ncohesion.\\u201d Dkt. 72-74 \\u00b6 13; see also Dkt. 72-72 \\u00b6 9. They testify that the Military Ban\\u2014not the\\n\\nAustin Policy\\u2014\\u201cis harmful to the military\\u201d and \\u201cundermines unit readiness.\\u201d Dkt. 72-59 \\u00b6 38;\\n\\nsee also Dkt. 72-72 \\u00b6 21 (\\u201c[A] prohibition on service by transgender individuals would degrade\\n\\nmilitary readiness and capabilities.\\u201d). Other than a limited foundation objection as to one\\n\\ndeclarant, Defendants do not rebut this testimony.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                59\\n\\f                      b.     Unit Cohesion, Good Order, and Discipline\\n\\n       Defendants further contend that \\u201cDoD reasonably determined that exempting individuals\\n\\nwith gender dysphoria who have undergone gender transition or seek to do so from the military\\u2019s\\n\\nsex-based standards would undermine good order, discipline, steady leadership, unit cohesion,\\n\\nand ultimately military effectiveness and lethality.\\u201d Opp. at 45 (cleaned up). They speculate that\\n\\n\\u201ca contrary approach would risk, among other things, eroding reasonable expectations of privacy\\n\\nby other servicemembers.\\u201d Id. (cleaned up). Defendants also assert that \\u201cDoD has expressed\\n\\nconcerns that exempting servicemembers from sex-based standards in training and athletic\\n\\ncompetitions on the basis of gender identity would generate perceptions of unfairness in the\\n\\nranks.\\u201d Id. at 47. And per Defendants, \\u201cDoD is also concerned that exempting servicemembers\\n\\nfrom uniform and grooming standards based on gender identity would create friction in the\\n\\nranks.\\u201d Id.\\n\\n       These justifications fail. To start, the Military Ban covers those who even \\u201cexhibit\\n\\nsymptoms consistent with[] gender dysphoria.\\u201d Hegseth Policy at 1 (emphasis added). Because\\n\\nit has no guard rails\\u2014i.e., what these symptoms include, how often they can be exhibited, who\\n\\ndecides whether they are being exhibited, Def. Concession Tr. (March 12, 2025) at 14\\u201315\\u2014this\\n\\nexclusion is so broad as to capture persons who have never had gender dysphoria, and therefore\\n\\ndo not even possibly present the same \\u201cconcerns.\\u201d\\n\\n       Defendants again rely almost exclusively on the Mattis Policy. See id. at 45\\u201349. But, yet\\n\\nagain, the Mattis Policy is woefully stale. See supra Findings of Fact II.B.1. Further, the\\n\\nMilitary Ban\\u2019s justifications impermissibly rely on \\u201coverbroad generalizations about the different\\n\\ntalents, capacities, or preferences of males and females.\\u201d VMI, 518 U.S. at 533. They also\\n\\nimpermissibly rely on not only overbroad, but also derogatory generalizations about the different\\n\\n\\n                                                60\\n\\ftalents, capacities, or preferences of transgender persons. Such overbroad generalizations do not\\n\\nsuffice to show that a sweeping discriminatory ban is substantially related to military readiness\\n\\nand unit cohesion.\\n\\n       Even if the Military Ban had focused solely on those diagnosed with gender dysphoria,\\n\\nDefendants do not identify any problem that needs a new solution. Appropriate treatment for\\n\\ngender dysphoria is both \\u201ceffective\\u201d and \\u201cno more specialized or difficult than other\\n\\nsophisticated medical care the military system routinely provides.\\u201d Dkt. 32-2 at 6, 9, 15. The\\n\\n2025 Medical Literature Review the Action Memo cites concludes that gender-affirming medical\\n\\ncare is highly effective. See supra Findings of Fact II.B.3. And recall that already under DoD\\n\\nInstruction 6130.0 (Medical Standards for Appointment, Enlistment, or Induction into the\\n\\nMilitary Services), individuals with a history of gender dysphoria seeking to enlist must be\\n\\n\\u201cstable\\u201d in their gender identity for 18 months before enlistment. Third Amend. Compl. \\u00b6 263.\\n\\nDefendants do not explain why addressing a treatable condition requires excluding all persons\\n\\nwho have ever had\\u2014or even exhibited symptoms of\\u2014it. Nor do they explain why the constraint\\n\\nalready in place, 18 months of stability, is insufficient.\\n\\n       These overbroad generalizations are also contradicted by the Record. Plaintiff Talbott\\n\\ntestifies: \\u201cIn each military setting I have worked in so far\\u2014basic training, Officer Candidate\\n\\nSchool, and my Reserve unit\\u2014I have been open about my transgender status and have felt\\n\\nwelcomed by my peers and supervisors.\\u201d Dkt. 72-18 \\u00b6 18. Plaintiff Vandal testifies that after\\n\\ncoming out she \\u201creceived nothing but support and acceptance from my command and others who\\n\\nlearned I was transgender. Since then, I have been promoted to my current rank of Major.\\u201d Dkt.\\n\\n72-20 \\u00b6 14\\u201315. Plaintiff Herrero testifies: \\u201cThe support of my leaders, peers, and subordinates\\n\\nthroughout my transition has not only made our units stronger but has also made me a more\\n\\n\\n                                                  61\\n\\feffective leader.\\u201d Dkt. 72-25 \\u00b6 16. Plaintiff Danridge testifies: \\u201cIn my time as both a Reservist\\n\\nand on active duty, my transgender status has rarely come up and has never been an issue. In\\n\\nfact, I received overwhelming support from my unit\\u2019s Commanding Officer to apply for\\n\\nOCS.\\u201d Dkt. 72-28 \\u00b6 24.\\n\\n       This testimony\\u2014which Defendants do not rebut\\u2014is a credit to the military\\u2019s ability to\\n\\nwelcome all those capable of serving. Indeed, had Defendants conferred with transgender\\n\\nservicemembers and those who serve with them, instead of making specious generalizations,\\n\\nthey might have learned that the Military Ban is little more than a solution in search of a\\n\\nproblem.\\n\\n                       c.     Disproportionate Costs\\n\\n       Defendants argue that \\u201cDoD reasonably concluded that its disproportionate expenditures\\n\\non facilitating gender transition should be better devoted elsewhere.\\u201d Opp. at 50. They explain\\n\\nthat \\u201cbetween 2015 and 2024, DoD spent $52,084,407 providing care to active-duty Service\\n\\nmembers to treat gender dysphoria\\u201d and that \\u201cmedical costs for servicemembers with gender\\n\\ndysphoria was nearly three times compared to servicemembers without this condition.\\u201d Id. at 49.\\n\\n       To support this \\u201cthree times\\u201d conclusion, Defendants rely on the Mattis Policy\\u2019s\\n\\nassessment of costs from the time before the Carter Policy was instituted through to the issuance\\n\\nof the Mattis Report (2014 to 2018). Dkt. 73-8 at 46. But the Mattis findings show that costs\\n\\nspiked after the military first began covering gender-affirming costs in September 2015, no doubt\\n\\nbecause of pent up demand. Dkt. 38-4 at 32. They began returning to baseline thereafter. Id.\\n\\nThat trend indicates two things. First, the Mattis Policy findings are outdated. Second, costs are\\n\\nlikely no longer disproportionate. This is confirmed by the AMSARA Report\\u2019s findings that\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                 62\\n\\foccurrence rates for common medical events are similar between transgender and non-\\n\\ntransgender service members. Dkt. 73-24 at 4.\\n\\n       As discussed in the Findings of Fact, Defendants cannot explain how transgender care\\n\\nhas resulted in \\u201cdisproportionate\\u201d costs for the military. See supra Findings of Fact II.B.4.\\n\\nWhen asked to provide the overall medical, psychotherapy, and surgical costs for all\\n\\nservicemembers so that some comparison could be made, Defendants could not answer. See Tr.\\n\\n(Mar. 12, 2025) at 144\\u201350. Without any source of comparison or benchmark, Defendants\\n\\ncannot claim that allowing transgender persons to serve results in \\u201cdisproportionate\\u201d costs for the\\n\\nmilitary.\\n\\n                       d.      The Hegseth Policy\\u2019s Exemption Provision\\n\\n       Defendants contend that the Hegseth Policy\\u2019s exemption provision addresses any\\n\\npotential issue. Opp. at 22\\u201323. Hardly. Transgender servicemembers can obtain an exemption\\n\\nif they show that they can safely perform all military tasks, and if retaining the servicemember\\n\\nwould support warfighting capabilities. Hegseth Policy at 8. Even then, the transgender person\\n\\ncan only continue to serve if: (1) they have been stable in their birth sex for 36 consecutive\\n\\nmonths, (2) they have never transitioned or even attempted to transition to any sex but their birth\\n\\nsex, and (3) they agree to serve in their birth sex. Id. Under this test, none of the Plaintiffs\\n\\nwould be eligible for an exemption. Indeed, it is hard to imagine anyone who could or, given the\\n\\nconstraints, would want to do so. Even with this non-exemption exemption, the Military Ban is\\n\\nnot even remotely, much less rationally or substantially, related to the Government\\u2019s goals. See\\n\\nsupra Findings of Fact II.\\n\\n       The Military Ban also prohibits the use of \\u201cinvented\\u201d pronouns used to \\u201cidentify\\u201d persons\\n\\nbecause they too are inconsistent with military readiness. EO14183 \\u00a7 4(b). This assertion makes\\n\\n\\n                                                  63\\n\\fno sense as written\\u2014all pronouns are invented and used to identify persons. That aside,\\n\\nDefendants could not even begin to identify how pronoun usage affects military readiness. Tr.\\n\\n(Mar. 12, 2025) at 198. The Court gave defense counsel the opportunity to present a witness\\u2014\\n\\nany witness\\u2014to state under oath that it does. Id. None materialized.\\n\\n                                             *****\\n\\n       Defendants have articulated important government objectives in military readiness, unit\\n\\ncohesion, and saving costs. But the Fifth Amendment requires more than pointing to such\\n\\n\\u201cbroadly formulated interests.\\u201d Singh, 56 F.4th at 97. Defendants must show that the\\n\\ndiscriminatory Military Ban is in some way substantially related to the achievement of those\\n\\nobjectives. And they must do so without relying on \\u201coverbroad generalizations about the\\n\\ndifferent talents, capacities, or preferences of males and females.\\u201d VMI, 518 U.S. at 538. They\\n\\ndo not come close. Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claim that the Military Ban fails\\n\\nintermediate scrutiny review.\\n\\n           C.     Animus\\n\\n       In our constitutional republic, citizens are free to hold and express divergent views. But\\n\\nwhen \\u201csincere, personal opposition [to a group of people] becomes enacted law and public\\n\\npolicy, the necessary consequence is to put the imprimatur of the State itself on an exclusion that\\n\\nsoon demeans or stigmatizes those whose own liberty is then denied.\\u201d Obergefell v.

See Hegseth Policy at 4. If this concern were\\n\\ngenuine, barrack assignments would be based on anatomical (phenotypic) sex, not reproductive\\n\\n(gonadal) sex. For intersex individuals, who can present in about forty different ways,29 the two\\n\\nare not necessarily aligned. A person with ovotestes has both ovarian and testicular tissue and so\\n\\npresumably could not be assigned to either male or female barracks, regardless of their\\n\\nanatomical sex.30 A person with male genitalia but female reproductive anatomy would be put in\\n\\nfemale barracks, undoing the very privacy concern the Military Ban purports to address.31 And\\n\\nhow will the military assure persons are tucked away in barracks without causing \\u201cprivacy\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n29\\n   The Cleveland Clinic\\u2019s intersex internet page addresses some of these presentations.

As discussed, the cost of medical care for transgender troops is de\\n\\nminimis. See supra Findings of Fact II.B.4.

Yet the defendants in those cases did not fail to proffer\\n\\nindependent justifications. Rather, the Supreme Court found those purported justifications to be\\n\\nlacking. See supra Analysis II.C.1. So, too, does this Court find Defendants\\u2019 justifications\\n\\nempty.\\n\\n         Defendants further argue that, to find animus, the Hawaii Court required that a law be\\n\\n\\u201cinexplicable by anything but animus.\\u201d Opp. at 51 (quoting Hawaii, 585 U.S. at 706). But this\\n\\nquote is inapposite for two reasons. First, this is not what the Supreme Court said. Rather, it\\n\\nconcluded that the entry restriction proclamation \\u201cd[id] not fit the pattern\\u201d of previous animus\\n\\ncases because it was neither \\u201cimpossible to discern a relationship to legitimate state interests\\u201d nor\\n\\nwas it \\u201cinexplicable by anything but animus.\\u201d Hawaii, 585 U.S. at 706 (cleaned up). Thus, at\\n\\nthe very least, the Hawaii Court offered two paths to a finding of animus: the lack of a\\n\\nrelationship to a legitimate state interest or the inability to explain by anything but animus. Id.\\n\\nThis Court, as discussed above, cannot conclude that the Military Ban is related to the\\n\\ngovernment\\u2019s interests in military readiness, unit cohesion, and cost reduction. So, applying the\\n\\nHawaii Court\\u2019s own language, Defendants\\u2019 argument fails.\\n\\n         Second, even if a law had to be inexplicable by anything but animus, the Court here has\\n\\nno trouble finding that the Military Ban fits this description. To recap, the Military Ban:\\n\\ndisqualifies all \\u201c[t]ransgender troops . . . without an exemption\\u201d; contains an exemption in name\\n\\nonly; relies on derogatory generalizations Defendants concede are pure conjecture; reflects no\\n\\nstudy of the service of transgender persons since 2021 and instead relies on \\u201cpredictions\\u201d made\\n\\n\\n                                                 71\\n\\fin 2018; egregiously misquotes studies and ignores data supporting service by transgender\\n\\npersons; asserts \\u201cjustifications\\u201d untethered to fact except insofar as Defendants\\u2019 own evidence\\n\\ncontradicts them; and bans certain medical treatments only when prescribed to transgender\\n\\nindividuals.

Dkt. 72-1 at 74. Since Plaintiffs cannot physically conform to those\\n\\n\\n46\\n   A \\u201cHobson\\u2019s choice\\u201d is a free choice in which there is only one real option. The term traces\\nits origin to Thomas Hobson, a sixteenth-century English stable owner who notoriously offered\\nhis customers a \\u201cchoice\\u201d of taking the horse closest to the door (so all would get equally used) or\\nleaving without a horse\\u2014essentially, no choice for those who needed a horse. See H.W.

See, e.g., Dkts. 72-19 \\u00b6 8; 72-22 \\u00b6 6; 72-24 \\u00b6 6. This then puts to\\n\\nPlaintiffs a Sophie\\u2019s choice.47 If they separate voluntarily, they will leave a career that they have\\n\\nno desire to end. If they opt for removal proceedings, they may be discharged dishonorably and,\\n\\nper the Hegseth Policy, will be required to repay the military their bonuses and other amounts.\\n\\nHegseth Policy at 7; Dkt. 79-1 at 7. Permitting the Hegseth Policy to remain in place during\\n\\nlitigation, therefore, will work an obvious hardship to the Plaintiffs.\\n\\n       Public interest considerations also support granting the preliminary injunction.

The Court details the scope of the\\n\\ninjunction in the Order that accompanies this Opinion. On its own motion, the Court stays this\\n\\ninjunction until March 21, 2025, at 10:00 am eastern, to provide Defendants time to consider\\n\\nfiling a motion for an emergency stay in the D.C. Circuit.\\n\\n       Defendants claim that any injunction must be limited to the Plaintiffs. Opp. at 61. It\\n\\ncannot be, rationally or logistically. Other transgender servicemembers face the same irreparable\\n\\nharms as Plaintiffs. Any transgender person affected by the Ban would need only to file a \\u201cme\\n\\ntoo\\u201d complaint in this Court to obtain the same relief. The Court and Defendants then would\\n\\nhave to deal with a never-ending conveyor belt of claims. A limited injunction would also cause\\n\\nhavoc for the Armed Forces. Some transgender persons would be permitted to serve and accede,\\n\\nothers would not. Depending on what happened at the permanent injunction phase, one group or\\n\\nthe other would be affected. Superiors and colleagues would need to keep track of ongoing\\n\\nlitigation docket updates to understand who was covered. Notably, the government has\\n\\nreiterated that \\u201cuniformity\\u201d is one of the key goals of the Military Ban multiple times throughout\\n\\nthis litigation.

In a\\n\\nhealthy democracy, both are positive outcomes. We should all agree, however, that every person\\n\\nwho has answered the call to serve deserves our gratitude and respect.

Factual\\n\\ndeterminations are reviewed for substantial evidence and legal determinations de\\n\\nnovo. Id.\\n\\n      1. Denial of the motion to continue. We review the denial of a motion to\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n  The BIA found that Petitioners waived their challenge to the IJ\\u2019s denial of\\nprotection under the Convention Against Torture (\\u201cCAT\\u201d), and Petitioners do not\\nchallenge that finding here. Accordingly, Petitioners have waived their CAT\\nclaims. See Lopez-Vasquez v. Holder, 706 F.3d 1072, 1079\\u201380 (9th Cir. 2013).\\n2\\n  Petitioners asserted they were persecuted on account of their political opinion, but\\nthey have since abandoned those claims on appeal.\\n\\n                                        2                                   24-2225\\n\\fcontinue for abuse of discretion. Garcia v. Lynch, 798 F.3d 876, 881 (9th Cir.\\n\\n2015), abrogated on other grounds by Coria v. Garland, 114 F.4th 994 (9th Cir.\\n\\n2024). A continuance may be granted when \\u201cgood cause\\u201d is shown, and the denial\\n\\nof a continuance \\u201cwill not be overturned except on a showing of clear abuse.\\u201d Id.\\n\\n(first quoting 8 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1003.29; and then quoting Sandoval-Luna v. Mukasey,\\n\\n526 F.3d 1243, 1247 (9th Cir. 2008)).\\n\\n      The BIA did not abuse its discretion when it found that the IJ did not err in\\n\\ndenying Petitioners\\u2019 request for a continuance. Petitioners argue that the IJ did not\\n\\napply the good cause standard, and that counsel\\u2019s personal emergency and\\n\\ntechnical difficulties justified a continuance. Not so. First, the IJ applied the good\\n\\ncause standard. Second, Petitioners were not prevented from submitting evidence.\\n\\nPetitioners\\u2019 counsel stated that a continuance would allow him to present legal\\n\\n\\u201cargument,\\u201d not additional evidence. Third, Petitioners previously received a\\n\\ncontinuance. Fourth, regarding the Petitioners\\u2019 technical difficulties, the IJ\\n\\nsuggested that Petitioners could resolve them by appearing in-person at the\\n\\nimmigration courthouse, which was half a block away from counsel\\u2019s office. But\\n\\ncounsel chose not to do so. Nonetheless, the IJ did offer to continue the hearing\\n\\nfor a week, but Petitioners\\u2019 counsel refused. Finally, Petitioners\\u2019 counsel\\n\\nrepresented that his own personal circumstances would not affect his ability to\\n\\nrepresent Petitioners. Accordingly, the agency did not abuse its discretion in\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         3                                    24-2225\\n\\fdenying Petitioners\\u2019 motion to continue.\\n\\n      2. Due Process. Allegations of due process violations are reviewed de novo.\\n\\nBenedicto v. Garland, 12 F.4th 1049, 1058 (9th Cir. 2021). To bring a viable due\\n\\nprocess claim, Petitioners must show: (1) that they were \\u201cprevented from\\n\\nreasonably presenting his [or her] case,\\u201d and (2) that they were prejudiced,\\n\\nmeaning that \\u201cthe outcome of the proceeding may have been affected by the\\n\\nalleged violation.\\u201d Ibarra-Flores v. Gonzalez, 439 F.3d 614, 620\\u201321 (9th Cir.\\n\\n2006) (citations omitted). A \\u201cviolation of rights\\u201d must exist to sustain a due\\n\\nprocess claim. Padilla-Martinez v. Holder, 770 F.3d 825, 830 (9th Cir. 2014).\\n\\nPetitioners argue three separate due process violations infringed on their right to a\\n\\nfull and fair hearing. But none holds merit.\\n\\n      First, Petitioners argue that the denial of their request to remove their\\n\\nproceedings from the \\u201cDedicated Docket\\u201d3 violated their due process rights.4 The\\n\\nrecord does not suggest that Petitioners were prevented from presenting their\\n\\nclaims. Even if Petitioners were placed on the Dedicated Docket \\u201csuddenly and\\n\\nwithout advance notice leaving Petitioners incapable of submitting evidence prior\\n\\n\\n3\\n  Cases on the \\u201cDedicated Docket\\u201d are fast tracked with the goal that cases are\\ncompleted \\u201cwithin 300 days after the initial master calendar hearing.\\u201d\\n4\\n  Petitioners also assert an equal protection claim that \\u201cSalvadorans remained on\\nthe Dedicated Docket subjected to expedited treatment while Nicaraguans and\\nother nationalities were taken off without notice.\\u201d But Petitioners do not present\\nfacts nor cite case law substantiating this claim. Thus, Petitioners have waived this\\nargument. Greenwood v. FAA, 28 F.3d 971, 977 (9th Cir. 1994).\\n\\n                                         4                                    24-2225\\n\\fto the individual hearing,\\u201d the IJ previously granted Petitioners a four-month\\n\\ncontinuance to gather evidence, which Petitioners used to do so. Thus, Petitioners\\n\\nfailed to assert a viable due process claim regarding the Dedicated Docket because\\n\\nthey suffered no prejudice.\\n\\n      Second, Petitioners argue that technical difficulties and translation errors\\n\\nresulted in a due process violation. Petitioners have due process rights to\\n\\ncompetent translation services. Kotasz v. INS, 31 F.3d 847, 850 n.2 (9th Cir.\\n\\n1994). But to demonstrate prejudice, they must show that \\u201ca better translation\\n\\nwould have made a difference in the outcome of the hearing.\\u201d Id. (quoting\\n\\nAcewicz v. INS, 984 F.2d 1056, 1063 (9th Cir. 1993)). Here, Petitioners fail to\\n\\nmake such a showing. The interpreter asked Petitioners to repeat their responses\\n\\nwhen he needed to clarify their testimony, and the interpreter noted that it was\\n\\n\\u201ceasy to clarify\\u201d confusion. Moreover, Petitioners do not identify any instances in\\n\\nthe record of specific translation errors or technical glitches that affected the\\n\\nfairness of the proceeding. Because Petitioners failed to demonstrate that \\u201cdefects\\n\\nin translation prejudiced the outcome of the hearing,\\u201d Petitioners\\u2019 due process\\n\\nclaim related to these issues fails. Aden v. Holder, 589 F.3d 1040, 1047 (9th Cir.\\n\\n2009).\\n\\n      Third, Petitioners argue they were deprived of their right to counsel. They\\n\\nargue that the IJ \\u201cactively kept Petitioners\\u2019 attorney from consulting his file and\\n\\n\\n\\n                                          5                                    24-2225\\n\\fcase notes during testimony,\\u201d that their counsel should have been allowed to\\n\\n\\u201cconsult[] with his Spanish speaking staff and his file in order to make proper\\n\\nobjections to the translation and to track where the technical issues were affecting\\n\\nPetitioners\\u2019 credibility,\\u201d and that the IJ\\u2019s \\u201cadmonishment of normal attorney\\n\\nbehavior . . . unduly interfered with Petitioners\\u2019 right to be represented in the\\n\\nproceedings.\\u201d None of these arguments demonstrate prejudice.\\n\\n      The IJ believed that counsel\\u2019s assistant \\u201cwas aiding [Petitioners] during their\\n\\ntestimony as [they] were frequently observed looking away from the camera,\\u201d and\\n\\nthe IJ instructed counsel not to talk to anybody else during the hearing. But, even\\n\\nif it were improper for the IJ to prevent Petitioners\\u2019 attorney from speaking to his\\n\\nSpanish speaking staff, Petitioners have not pointed to any instance in the record in\\n\\nwhich a translation error may have affected the outcome of the proceeding.\\n\\nAccordingly, Petitioners have not demonstrated the requisite prejudice to state a\\n\\ndue process claim.\\n\\n      3. Adverse Credibility. We review adverse credibility determinations for\\n\\nsubstantial evidence. Shrestha v. Holder, 590 F.3d 1034, 1039 (9th Cir. 2010).\\n\\n\\u201c[O]nly the most extraordinary circumstances will justify overturning an adverse\\n\\ncredibility determination.\\u201d Id. at 1041 (quoting Jibril v. Gonzales, 423 F.3d 1129,\\n\\n1138 n.1 (9th Cir. 2005)). The agency must \\u201cprovide specific and cogent reasons\\n\\nin support of an adverse credibility determination,\\u201d and it must refer to \\u201cspecific\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         6                                    24-2225\\n\\finstances in the record.\\u201d Id. at 1044 (citation omitted). Trivial or minor errors\\n\\nshould not be considered, but \\u201cminor inconsistencies, when aggregated or when\\n\\nviewed in light of the total circumstances, may undermine credibility.\\u201d Id. at\\n\\n1043\\u201344, 1043 n.4. Substantial evidence supports the BIA\\u2019s finding that both\\n\\nMelgar\\u2019s testimony and Perez\\u2019s testimony were not credible.\\n\\n      The BIA identified material internal inconsistencies between Melgar\\u2019s\\n\\ntestimony and her declaration. First, in Melgar\\u2019s written declaration, Melgar\\n\\nprovided details and timelines of when and where specific gang threats against\\n\\nPerez occurred. But Melgar testified that she did not know when and where the\\n\\ngang threats occurred. Nor could she explain why, notwithstanding her lack of\\n\\nknowledge, these details were in her written declaration. Second, Melgar\\u2019s\\n\\ntestimony was inconsistent regarding whether the threats against Perez were\\n\\nreported to the police. Melgar\\u2019s written declaration stated that Perez filed a police\\n\\nreport at her insistence, but she testified that \\u201c[b]ecause of fear, we did not go [to\\n\\nthe police].\\u201d Though Melgar now argues that this testimony \\u201caccurately\\n\\nrepresented the inconsistency of the family deciding whether or not to report the\\n\\npersecution to the police,\\u201d5 substantial evidence supports the agency\\u2019s finding that\\n\\n\\n\\n5\\n  Melgar also argues that there was either a translation error or glitch in the\\ntechnology which led to this inconsistency in Melgar\\u2019s testimony. But Petitioners\\u2019\\ncounsel did not object to the translation, nor do Petitioners proffer on appeal what\\nthe correct translation should have been.\\n\\n                                          7                                    24-2225\\n\\fMelgar was not a credible witness.\\n\\n      Similarly, the BIA found material inconsistencies within Perez\\u2019s testimony.\\n\\nPerez testified that he was not threatened in El Callejon, but that contradicted the\\n\\npolice report he filed, which stated that he was threatened in El Callejon.\\n\\nAdditionally, the agency found it \\u201cimplausible\\u201d that gangs would look for Perez at\\n\\nhis sister\\u2019s house a two-and-a-half-hour drive away but never look for him at his\\n\\nown house. It was not error for the agency to make such a \\u201ccommon sense\\u201d\\n\\nadverse credibility finding. Lalayan v. Garland, 4 F.4th 822, 835 (9th Cir. 2021).\\n\\n      Moreover, the agency permissibly found that Perez was evasive and non-\\n\\nresponsive in portions of his testimony. Perez was evasive when asked about the\\n\\nneighbor who witnessed the alleged gang threats. Taken with Perez\\u2019s inconsistent\\n\\ntestimony, there is substantial evidence in the record to support the agency\\u2019s\\n\\nfinding that Perez was not a credible witness.\\n\\n      Absent Petitioners\\u2019 discredited testimony, there is no independent\\n\\ncorroborative evidence that establishes their eligibility for asylum or withholding\\n\\nof removal. See Wang v. Sessions, 861 F.3d 1003, 1009 (9th Cir. 2017).\\n\\nAccordingly, substantial evidence supports the agency\\u2019s denials of asylum and\\n\\nwithholding of removal.\\n\\n      PETITION DENIED.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         8                                    24-2225\\n\\f\",\n",

Substantial evidence supports the BIA\\u2019s finding that both\\n\\nMelgar\\u2019s testimony and Perez\\u2019s testimony were not credible.\\n\\n      The BIA identified material internal inconsistencies between Melgar\\u2019s\\n\\ntestimony and her declaration. First, in Melgar\\u2019s written declaration, Melgar\\n\\nprovided details and timelines of when and where specific gang threats against\\n\\nPerez occurred. But Melgar testified that she did not know when and where the\\n\\ngang threats occurred. Nor could she explain why, notwithstanding her lack of\\n\\nknowledge, these details were in her written declaration. Second, Melgar\\u2019s\\n\\ntestimony was inconsistent regarding whether the threats against Perez were\\n\\nreported to the police. Melgar\\u2019s written declaration stated that Perez filed a police\\n\\nreport at her insistence, but she testified that \\u201c[b]ecause of fear, we did not go [to\\n\\nthe police].\\u201d Though Melgar now argues that this testimony \\u201caccurately\\n\\nrepresented the inconsistency of the family deciding whether or not to report the\\n\\npersecution to the police,\\u201d5 substantial evidence supports the agency\\u2019s finding that\\n\\n\\n\\n5\\n  Melgar also argues that there was either a translation error or glitch in the\\ntechnology which led to this inconsistency in Melgar\\u2019s testimony. But Petitioners\\u2019\\ncounsel did not object to the translation, nor do Petitioners proffer on appeal what\\nthe correct translation should have been.\\n\\n                                          7                                    24-2225\\n\\fMelgar was not a credible witness.\\n\\n      Similarly, the BIA found material inconsistencies within Perez\\u2019s testimony.\\n\\nPerez testified that he was not threatened in El Callejon, but that contradicted the\\n\\npolice report he filed, which stated that he was threatened in El Callejon.\\n\\nAdditionally, the agency found it \\u201cimplausible\\u201d that gangs would look for Perez at\\n\\nhis sister\\u2019s house a two-and-a-half-hour drive away but never look for him at his\\n\\nown house.

Perez was evasive when asked about the\\n\\nneighbor who witnessed the alleged gang threats. Taken with Perez\\u2019s inconsistent\\n\\ntestimony, there is substantial evidence in the record to support the agency\\u2019s\\n\\nfinding that Perez was not a credible witness.\\n\\n      Absent Petitioners\\u2019 discredited testimony, there is no independent\\n\\ncorroborative evidence that establishes their eligibility for asylum or withholding\\n\\nof removal.

Photographs presented by Plaintiffs show that the tenant parked\\n\\nhis car in the rental portion of the shop, behind the couch in the living area.\\n\\n        At trial, Rick Johnson testified that, when the rental was established in 2017, he\\n\\nresearched comparable rentals in the area using newspapers and online resources. He identified\\n\\na nearby \\u201cstudio-efficiency\\u201d apartment offered at $650 per month and a one-bedroom rental for\\n\\n$749 per month. Based on these comparisons and the shop\\u2019s limited amenities, he set the rent at\\n\\n$550 per month. (Ptfs\\u2019 Ex 19 at 13.) However, due to the tenant\\u2019s financial difficulties,\\n\\nPlaintiffs accepted $500 per month during the tax years in issue.\\n\\n        Plaintiffs deducted business rental expenses as follows:1\\n\\n Exp.

The\\n\\nroad included several turnouts: one to the neighbor\\u2019s property, one to the barn, one to the shop\\n\\nrental, and one extending to an existing concrete pad in front of Plaintiffs\\u2019 residence. (Ptfs\\u2019 Ex\\n\\n10 at 1.) The total cost to pave the road was $57,774, broken down as follows:\\n\\n             (1) A parking space outside of the [shop]/rental unit $13,255\\n             (2) Private driveway of 9550 sq. ft. 9\\u2019 wide flairs and turnout for $27,362\\n             (3) A common driveway of 10\\u2019 wide with flairs, turnouts, and mailbox $17,157\\n\\n(Def\\u2019s Ex A at 4.)\\n\\n        Based on testimony and evidence presented at trial, the \\u201ccommon driveway\\u201d refers to the\\n\\nportion of the road beginning at NE Chehalem Drive and ending at the turnout to the neighbor\\u2019s\\n\\nproperty, while the \\u201cprivate driveway\\u201d extends from the neighbor\\u2019s property turnout to the new\\n\\nparking space outside the shop. The common driveway is used by Plaintiffs, their renter(s), and\\n\\ntheir neighbor(s), whereas the private driveway is used exclusively by Plaintiffs and their\\n\\nrenter(s).\\n\\n        On their 2019 tax return, Plaintiffs allocated 50 percent of the total paving cost ($28,887)\\n\\nto the rental and claimed 100 percent bonus depreciation for that amount. (Def\\u2019s Ex F at 7.)\\n\\nDefendant disallowed this depreciation, as well as Plaintiffs\\u2019 other rental expense deductions\\n\\nunder Internal Revenue Code (IRC) section 280A, asserting the property was not rented at a fair\\n\\nmarket rate. (Def\\u2019s Ex B at 2.) Relying on a 2019 HUD publication, Defendant determined that\\n\\nthe average rental rate for studio apartments in Plaintiffs\\u2019 zip code area was $1,080 per month.\\n\\nOn this basis, Defendant recaptured prior depreciation and disallowed losses previously taken\\n\\nsince 2015. (Id.) Defendant reclassified rental income from Schedule E to Schedule 1 as general\\n\\nincome, requiring expenses to be itemized.

ANALYSIS\\n\\n       The court must determine whether Plaintiffs\\u2019 property was rented at fair market value to\\n\\njustify the deduction of expenses and depreciation. Additionally, the court must assess whether\\n\\nPlaintiffs\\u2019 road improvements qualify for bonus depreciation. Resolving these issues requires a\\n\\nbrief review of a few foundational aspects of Oregon income tax law.\\n\\n       Oregon\\u2019s income tax system generally mirrors federal tax provisions unless there are\\n\\nexplicit modifications, additions, or subtractions which are not applicable here. ORS 316.048.2\\n\\nUnder IRC section 162(a), taxpayers may deduct \\u201cordinary and necessary expenses paid or\\n\\nincurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business[.]\\u201d Deductions are a\\n\\n\\u201cmatter of legislative grace,\\u201d and taxpayers bear the burden of substantiating income and\\n\\ndeductions with sufficient records. ORS 305.427; IRC \\u00a7 6001; Treas Reg \\u00a7 1.6001\\u20131(a);\\n\\nINDOPCO, Inc. v. Comm\\u2019r, 503 US 79, 84, 112 S Ct 1039, 117 L Ed 2d 226 (1992).\\n\\nDepreciation deductions account for the exhaustion and wear of property used to generate\\n\\nincome.

However, under IRC section 280A, property used as a taxpayer\\u2019s residence is\\n\\npresumed to be used for personal purposes--and thus ineligible for business-related deductions--\\n\\nunless it is rented at fair market value. IRC \\u00a7 280A (d)(2)(C).\\n\\nA.     Fair Market Rent\\n\\n       Under the framework described above, the court must determine whether Plaintiffs rented\\n\\n\\n       2\\n           The court\\u2019s references to the Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS) are to 2017.\\n\\n\\n\\nDECISION TC-MD 230350R                                                                             4\\n\\ftheir property at fair market value. A \\u201ctaxpayer shall be deemed to have used a dwelling unit for\\n\\npersonal purposes for a day * * * unless for such day the dwelling unit is rented for a rental\\n\\nwhich, under the facts and circumstances, is fair rental.\\u201d IRC \\u00a7 280A (d)(2) (emphasis added).\\n\\nDefendant argued the property was rented below market value and, therefore disallowed\\n\\nPlaintiffs\\u2019 rental expenses. However, Plaintiffs presented evidence of the $500 monthly rent\\n\\ncharged to an unrelated tenant, provided local rental comparisons, and submitted photographs\\n\\ndepicting the shop\\u2019s spartan condition.\\n\\n       The court observes that Defendant\\u2019s reliance on average rent data from HUD failed to\\n\\naccount for the shop\\u2019s unique characteristics, as it more closely resembles a garage than an\\n\\napartment. Although minimal, Plaintiffs\\u2019 evidence was more persuasive than Defendant\\u2019s\\n\\ngeneralized data. The court therefore concludes that Plaintiff rented their property at fair market\\n\\nvalue. Consequently, Defendant\\u2019s recapture of prior depreciation and losses was improper, and\\n\\nmust be reversed. Having established that the property was rented at fair market value, and\\n\\nwithout Defendant specifically challenging the substantiation of the rental business expenses, the\\n\\ncourt also reverses Defendant\\u2019s disallowance of Plaintiffs\\u2019 rental expense deductions.\\n\\nB.     Bonus Depreciation for Road Paving\\n\\n       Having addressed the smaller business-related expenses, the court now turns to the larger\\n\\ndepreciation deduction at issue. The court finds that Plaintiffs are entitled to a depreciation\\n\\ndeduction for a portion of the paved road that is reasonably attributable to the rental.\\n\\n       While deductions for business expenses are generally disallowed when connected with\\n\\nthe use of a taxpayer\\u2019s residence, an exception exists for \\u201cany item which is attributable to the\\n\\nrental of [a] dwelling unit or portion thereof.\\u201d IRC \\u00a7 280A(a), (c)(3). Land improvements, such\\n\\nas paved roads, do not qualify for depreciation under IRC section 179. IRS Pub 946 at 17\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDECISION TC-MD 230350R                                                                              5\\n\\f(2019), available at https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/p946--2019.pdf. However, IRC section\\n\\n167(a) allows depreciation deductions for property used in a trade or business, and section\\n\\n168(k) provides for accelerating the depreciation of roads because they are qualified property\\n\\nwithin the meaning of the statute. This \\u201cbonus depreciation,\\u201d as it is commonly called, is a result\\n\\nof the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), effective January 1, 2018, which makes 100 percent first-\\n\\nyear bonus depreciation available for certain \\u201cqualified property\\u201d that is used for business,\\n\\nplaced in service during certain periods, and new to the taxpayer. 26 USC \\u00a7 168(k).\\n\\n        1. Qualified Property\\n\\n        Having generally laid out the requirements for bonus depreciation eligibility, the court\\n\\naddresses whether Plaintiffs\\u2019 paved road meets the specific statutory requirements of \\u201cqualified\\n\\nproperty.\\u201d Bonus depreciation applies to property (1) with a recovery period of 20 years or less,\\n\\nsuch as land improvements, (2) that was first used by the taxpayer, and (3) that was placed in\\n\\nservice by the taxpayer before January 1, 2027. 26 USC \\u00a7 168(k)(1)-(2). Paved roads are\\n\\nclassified as land improvements under the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System\\n\\n(MACRS) and have a recovery period of 15 years. IRS Pub 946, Appendix B, Table B-1 (2019),\\n\\navailable at https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/p946--2019.pdf. Here, the paved road meets these\\n\\ncriteria, as it was gravel prior to Plaintiffs\\u2019 paved it, establishing first use by the taxpayer, and\\n\\nwas placed in service on September 25, 2019. (Def\\u2019s Ex F at 7.)\\n\\n        2. Business Use Requirement\\n\\n        Having established that Plaintiffs\\u2019 paved road is generally eligible for bonus depreciation,\\n\\nthe court next determines the portion of the road\\u2019s depreciation that is eligible. Property must be\\n\\nused in a trade or business or held for the production of income to qualify for a depreciation\\n\\ndeduction. IRC \\u00a7 167(a)(1)-(2). Plaintiffs allocated a portion of the road to rental use, and\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDECISION TC-MD 230350R                                                                                  6\\n\\frenting qualifies as a business activity. Property used for both personal and rental activity is\\n\\neligible for depreciation, but the amount must be allocated on a reasonable basis. See IRS Pub\\n\\n527 at 16 (2019), available at https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/p527--2019.pdf (describing how\\n\\nto divide expenses that are \\u201cfor both rental use and personal use\\u201d). Square footage is one way of\\n\\nallocating the expense, but \\u201cany reasonable method\\u201d may be used. Id.\\n\\n       Although the road paving qualifies as eligible for depreciation, the court finds that\\n\\nPlaintiffs\\u2019 allocation of 50 percent of the cost to rental expense was not supported--or in other\\n\\nwords, less than half of the property was used for the production of income. A more reasonable\\n\\nallocation in this case would be based on the use of the rental property relative to Plaintiffs\\u2019 total\\n\\nproperty. A challenge to this analysis is that neither party presented direct evidence of the square\\n\\nfootage calculation used to allocate other expenses. In the court\\u2019s view, the most reasonable use\\n\\nallocation based on facts in the record is as follows.\\n\\n       The parking space outside the shop/rental unit provides parking for both the rental and\\n\\nnon-rental portions of the shop. The square footage of the rental is one-third of the total square\\n\\nfootage of the shop. Therefore, one-third of the cost to pave the parking area ($4,418) is\\n\\nreasonably allocable to the rental.\\n\\n       The private driveway serves two buildings: the Plaintiffs\\u2019 residence and the shop. Half of\\n\\nthis stretch of the driveway, therefore, is for Plaintiffs\\u2019 personal use only. The other half of this\\n\\nstretch goes to the shop, of which one-third is allocable to the rental. Therefore, one-third of half\\n\\nthe cost of the private driveway ($4,560) is reasonably allocable to the rental.\\n\\n       The common driveway serves the two buildings owned by Plaintiffs, plus a third point of\\n\\ninterest: the neighbor\\u2019s driveway. Therefore, two-thirds of this section are unrelated to the shop.\\n\\nOne-third of this section is allocable to the shop, one-third of which is allocable to the rental.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDECISION TC-MD 230350R                                                                                  7\\n\\fTherefore, one-third of one-third the cost of the common driveway ($1,906) is reasonably\\n\\nallocable to the rental. In sum, $10,884 of the total paving costs are reasonably allocable to the\\n\\nPlaintiffs\\u2019 rental.\\n\\n                                        III. CONCLUSION\\n\\n        After careful consideration, the court finds that Plaintiffs charged fair market rent for\\n\\ntheir shop rental, the expenses claimed on Schedule E, and the net losses from the rental are\\n\\nallowed. Plaintiffs\\u2019 paving costs attributable to the rental are eligible for bonus depreciation, but\\n\\nthe remainder of the paving costs were for personal use and are therefore excluded. Now,\\n\\ntherefore,\\n\\n        IT IS THE DECISION OF THIS COURT that Plaintiffs\\u2019 appeal is granted, in part.\\n\\nDefendant\\u2019s Assessment moving rental income from Schedule E (rental income) to Schedule 1\\n\\n(other income), denial of net losses, and recapture of prior depreciation back to 2015 are\\n\\nreversed. Defendant\\u2019s Assessment disallowing rental expenses for the tax years in issue is\\n\\nreversed. Plaintiffs are eligible for 100 percent bonus depreciation on their road improvements\\n\\nin 2019 in the amount of $10,884.\\n\\n        IT IS FURTHER DECIDED that Defendant shall adjust Plaintiffs\\u2019 AGI sensitive\\n\\ndeductions after calculating the changes made pursuant to this decision.\\n\\n\\n                                                              RICHARD D.

STATEMENT OF FACTS\\n\\n        Plaintiffs own property in the hills of Newberg, Oregon, which includes their principal\\n\\nresidence, a 2,400-square foot shop, and a barn. An 800-square foot portion of the shop is used\\n\\nas a residential rental, featuring concrete floors, high windows, a wood stove, a bathroom, and a\\n\\nhalf-wall creating a bedroom. Plaintiffs furnished the unit with a refrigerator, stove,\\n\\nwasher/dryer, and an old couch. Photographs presented by Plaintiffs show that the tenant parked\\n\\nhis car in the rental portion of the shop, behind the couch in the living area.\\n\\n        At trial, Rick Johnson testified that, when the rental was established in 2017, he\\n\\nresearched comparable rentals in the area using newspapers and online resources. He identified\\n\\na nearby \\u201cstudio-efficiency\\u201d apartment offered at $650 per month and a one-bedroom rental for\\n\\n$749 per month. Based on these comparisons and the shop\\u2019s limited amenities, he set the rent at\\n\\n$550 per month. (Ptfs\\u2019 Ex 19 at 13.) However, due to the tenant\\u2019s financial difficulties,\\n\\nPlaintiffs accepted $500 per month during the tax years in issue.\\n\\n        Plaintiffs deducted business rental expenses as follows:1\\n\\n Exp.

The total cost to pave the road was $57,774, broken down as follows:\\n\\n             (1) A parking space outside of the [shop]/rental unit $13,255\\n             (2) Private driveway of 9550 sq. ft. 9\\u2019 wide flairs and turnout for $27,362\\n             (3) A common driveway of 10\\u2019 wide with flairs, turnouts, and mailbox $17,157\\n\\n(Def\\u2019s Ex A at 4.)\\n\\n        Based on testimony and evidence presented at trial, the \\u201ccommon driveway\\u201d refers to the\\n\\nportion of the road beginning at NE Chehalem Drive and ending at the turnout to the neighbor\\u2019s\\n\\nproperty, while the \\u201cprivate driveway\\u201d extends from the neighbor\\u2019s property turnout to the new\\n\\nparking space outside the shop. The common driveway is used by Plaintiffs, their renter(s), and\\n\\ntheir neighbor(s), whereas the private driveway is used exclusively by Plaintiffs and their\\n\\nrenter(s).\\n\\n        On their 2019 tax return, Plaintiffs allocated 50 percent of the total paving cost ($28,887)\\n\\nto the rental and claimed 100 percent bonus depreciation for that amount. (Def\\u2019s Ex F at 7.)\\n\\nDefendant disallowed this depreciation, as well as Plaintiffs\\u2019 other rental expense deductions\\n\\nunder Internal Revenue Code (IRC) section 280A, asserting the property was not rented at a fair\\n\\nmarket rate. (Def\\u2019s Ex B at 2.) Relying on a 2019 HUD publication, Defendant determined that\\n\\nthe average rental rate for studio apartments in Plaintiffs\\u2019 zip code area was $1,080 per month.\\n\\nOn this basis, Defendant recaptured prior depreciation and disallowed losses previously taken\\n\\nsince 2015. (Id.) Defendant reclassified rental income from Schedule E to Schedule 1 as general\\n\\nincome, requiring expenses to be itemized. Additionally, Defendant disallowed Plaintiffs\\u2019 100\\n\\npercent bonus depreciation for the road paving, concluding the expense was not eligible for such\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDECISION TC-MD 230350R                                                                               3\\n\\ftreatment under IRC section 179 and must instead be depreciated over 15 years.

ANALYSIS\\n\\n       The court must determine whether Plaintiffs\\u2019 property was rented at fair market value to\\n\\njustify the deduction of expenses and depreciation. Additionally, the court must assess whether\\n\\nPlaintiffs\\u2019 road improvements qualify for bonus depreciation. Resolving these issues requires a\\n\\nbrief review of a few foundational aspects of Oregon income tax law.\\n\\n       Oregon\\u2019s income tax system generally mirrors federal tax provisions unless there are\\n\\nexplicit modifications, additions, or subtractions which are not applicable here.

Fair Market Rent\\n\\n       Under the framework described above, the court must determine whether Plaintiffs rented\\n\\n\\n       2\\n           The court\\u2019s references to the Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS) are to 2017.\\n\\n\\n\\nDECISION TC-MD 230350R                                                                             4\\n\\ftheir property at fair market value. A \\u201ctaxpayer shall be deemed to have used a dwelling unit for\\n\\npersonal purposes for a day * * * unless for such day the dwelling unit is rented for a rental\\n\\nwhich, under the facts and circumstances, is fair rental.\\u201d IRC \\u00a7 280A (d)(2) (emphasis added).\\n\\nDefendant argued the property was rented below market value and, therefore disallowed\\n\\nPlaintiffs\\u2019 rental expenses. However, Plaintiffs presented evidence of the $500 monthly rent\\n\\ncharged to an unrelated tenant, provided local rental comparisons, and submitted photographs\\n\\ndepicting the shop\\u2019s spartan condition.\\n\\n       The court observes that Defendant\\u2019s reliance on average rent data from HUD failed to\\n\\naccount for the shop\\u2019s unique characteristics, as it more closely resembles a garage than an\\n\\napartment. Although minimal, Plaintiffs\\u2019 evidence was more persuasive than Defendant\\u2019s\\n\\ngeneralized data. The court therefore concludes that Plaintiff rented their property at fair market\\n\\nvalue. Consequently, Defendant\\u2019s recapture of prior depreciation and losses was improper, and\\n\\nmust be reversed. Having established that the property was rented at fair market value, and\\n\\nwithout Defendant specifically challenging the substantiation of the rental business expenses, the\\n\\ncourt also reverses Defendant\\u2019s disallowance of Plaintiffs\\u2019 rental expense deductions.\\n\\nB.     Bonus Depreciation for Road Paving\\n\\n       Having addressed the smaller business-related expenses, the court now turns to the larger\\n\\ndepreciation deduction at issue. The court finds that Plaintiffs are entitled to a depreciation\\n\\ndeduction for a portion of the paved road that is reasonably attributable to the rental.\\n\\n       While deductions for business expenses are generally disallowed when connected with\\n\\nthe use of a taxpayer\\u2019s residence, an exception exists for \\u201cany item which is attributable to the\\n\\nrental of [a] dwelling unit or portion thereof.\\u201d IRC \\u00a7 280A(a), (c)(3).

However, IRC section\\n\\n167(a) allows depreciation deductions for property used in a trade or business, and section\\n\\n168(k) provides for accelerating the depreciation of roads because they are qualified property\\n\\nwithin the meaning of the statute. This \\u201cbonus depreciation,\\u201d as it is commonly called, is a result\\n\\nof the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), effective January 1, 2018, which makes 100 percent first-\\n\\nyear bonus depreciation available for certain \\u201cqualified property\\u201d that is used for business,\\n\\nplaced in service during certain periods, and new to the taxpayer. </pre><span class=\\\"citation no-link\\\">26 USC \\u00a7 168</span><pre class=\\\"inline\\\">(k).\\n\\n        1. Qualified Property\\n\\n        Having generally laid out the requirements for bonus depreciation eligibility, the court\\n\\naddresses whether Plaintiffs\\u2019 paved road meets the specific statutory requirements of \\u201cqualified\\n\\nproperty.\\u201d Bonus depreciation applies to property (1) with a recovery period of 20 years or less,\\n\\nsuch as land improvements, (2) that was first used by the taxpayer, and (3) that was placed in\\n\\nservice by the taxpayer before January 1, 2027. </pre><span class=\\\"citation no-link\\\">26 USC \\u00a7 168</span><pre class=\\\"inline\\\">(k)(1)-(2).

IRS Pub 946, Appendix B, Table B-1 (2019),\\n\\navailable at https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/p946--2019.pdf. Here, the paved road meets these\\n\\ncriteria, as it was gravel prior to Plaintiffs\\u2019 paved it, establishing first use by the taxpayer, and\\n\\nwas placed in service on September 25, 2019. (Def\\u2019s Ex F at 7.)\\n\\n        2. Business Use Requirement\\n\\n        Having established that Plaintiffs\\u2019 paved road is generally eligible for bonus depreciation,\\n\\nthe court next determines the portion of the road\\u2019s depreciation that is eligible. Property must be\\n\\nused in a trade or business or held for the production of income to qualify for a depreciation\\n\\ndeduction. IRC \\u00a7 167(a)(1)-(2). Plaintiffs allocated a portion of the road to rental use, and\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDECISION TC-MD 230350R                                                                                  6\\n\\frenting qualifies as a business activity. Property used for both personal and rental activity is\\n\\neligible for depreciation, but the amount must be allocated on a reasonable basis. See IRS Pub\\n\\n527 at 16 (2019), available at https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/p527--2019.pdf (describing how\\n\\nto divide expenses that are \\u201cfor both rental use and personal use\\u201d). Square footage is one way of\\n\\nallocating the expense, but \\u201cany reasonable method\\u201d may be used. Id.\\n\\n       Although the road paving qualifies as eligible for depreciation, the court finds that\\n\\nPlaintiffs\\u2019 allocation of 50 percent of the cost to rental expense was not supported--or in other\\n\\nwords, less than half of the property was used for the production of income. A more reasonable\\n\\nallocation in this case would be based on the use of the rental property relative to Plaintiffs\\u2019 total\\n\\nproperty. A challenge to this analysis is that neither party presented direct evidence of the square\\n\\nfootage calculation used to allocate other expenses. In the court\\u2019s view, the most reasonable use\\n\\nallocation based on facts in the record is as follows.\\n\\n       The parking space outside the shop/rental unit provides parking for both the rental and\\n\\nnon-rental portions of the shop. The square footage of the rental is one-third of the total square\\n\\nfootage of the shop. Therefore, one-third of the cost to pave the parking area ($4,418) is\\n\\nreasonably allocable to the rental.\\n\\n       The private driveway serves two buildings: the Plaintiffs\\u2019 residence and the shop. Half of\\n\\nthis stretch of the driveway, therefore, is for Plaintiffs\\u2019 personal use only. The other half of this\\n\\nstretch goes to the shop, of which one-third is allocable to the rental. Therefore, one-third of half\\n\\nthe cost of the private driveway ($4,560) is reasonably allocable to the rental.\\n\\n       The common driveway serves the two buildings owned by Plaintiffs, plus a third point of\\n\\ninterest: the neighbor\\u2019s driveway. Therefore, two-thirds of this section are unrelated to the shop.\\n\\nOne-third of this section is allocable to the shop, one-third of which is allocable to the rental.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDECISION TC-MD 230350R                                                                                  7\\n\\fTherefore, one-third of one-third the cost of the common driveway ($1,906) is reasonably\\n\\nallocable to the rental. In sum, $10,884 of the total paving costs are reasonably allocable to the\\n\\nPlaintiffs\\u2019 rental.\\n\\n                                        III. CONCLUSION\\n\\n        After careful consideration, the court finds that Plaintiffs charged fair market rent for\\n\\ntheir shop rental, the expenses claimed on Schedule E, and the net losses from the rental are\\n\\nallowed. Plaintiffs\\u2019 paving costs attributable to the rental are eligible for bonus depreciation, but\\n\\nthe remainder of the paving costs were for personal use and are therefore excluded. Now,\\n\\ntherefore,\\n\\n        IT IS THE DECISION OF THIS COURT that Plaintiffs\\u2019 appeal is granted, in part.\\n\\nDefendant\\u2019s Assessment moving rental income from Schedule E (rental income) to Schedule 1\\n\\n(other income), denial of net losses, and recapture of prior depreciation back to 2015 are\\n\\nreversed. Defendant\\u2019s Assessment disallowing rental expenses for the tax years in issue is\\n\\nreversed. Plaintiffs are eligible for 100 percent bonus depreciation on their road improvements\\n\\nin 2019 in the amount of $10,884.\\n\\n        IT IS FURTHER DECIDED that Defendant shall adjust Plaintiffs\\u2019 AGI sensitive\\n\\ndeductions after calculating the changes made pursuant to this decision.\\n\\n\\n                                                              RICHARD D.

We review the following restated issue on appeal:\\n\\n          Whether the District Court erred in awarding restitution based on an insurer\\u2019s\\n          testimony that the contested damage was attributable to the defendant\\u2019s theft\\n          and the District Court concluded that the defendant\\u2019s conflicting testimony was\\n          not credible.\\n\\nWe affirm.\\n\\n                 FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\\n\\n\\u00b62    On November 19, 2020, Raver was pulled over after a Yellowstone County deputy\\n\\nobserved him driving a black Ford F-150 confirmed to be a stolen vehicle. Both Raver and\\n\\nhis passenger were arrested at the scene on unrelated outstanding warrants. The truck\\u2019s\\n\\nowner, Stacie Grandpre (Grandpre), confirmed that she did not know Raver and had not\\n\\ngiven him permission to drive her truck. Grandpre gave the deputies consent to search the\\n\\nvehicle. Upon searching, deputies found several syringes and a spoon with a crystalline\\n\\nsubstance, as well as spools of copper wire and tools belonging to Montana Rail Link.\\n\\n\\u00b63    The State charged Raver by Information with six counts, including felony theft\\n\\npursuant to \\u00a7 45-6-301(1), MCA; felony theft pursuant to \\u00a7 45-6-301(3), MCA; and four\\n\\nmisdemeanors for possession of marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia, driving while\\n\\nsuspended, and theft of the copper wire. Pursuant to a plea agreement, Raver entered a no\\n\\ncontest plea for the felony theft under \\u00a7 45-6-301(3) (purposely or knowingly obtaining\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                           2\\n\\fcontrol over property known to have been stolen by another) and misdemeanor theft of the\\n\\ncopper wire, and the rest of the charges were dropped.\\n\\n\\u00b64     Following the theft, the truck underwent extensive repair and replacement work\\n\\nincluding several completely new components; of note, the back bumper was replaced\\n\\ndespite Grandpre\\u2019s original theft report stating that \\u201cthe driver side bumper [was] tied with\\n\\ncamo string.\\u201d In her victim statement, Grandpre also noted the loss and replacement costs\\n\\nof her hunting gear which had been stolen with the truck. She characterized her truck as\\n\\n\\u201cruined.\\u201d In total, the State requested $17,470.36 in restitution, which accounted for\\n\\nGrandpre\\u2019s hunting gear, car rentals, cleaning costs, and vehicle damage as paid by\\n\\nGrandpre\\u2019s insurer. Raver contested this amount.\\n\\n\\u00b65     The District Court heard argument on the restitution issue at the May 17, 2023\\n\\nsentencing hearing. In support of the restitution award, the State presented Cleve Shaw\\n\\n(Shaw), a State Farm Insurance claims specialist. On cross-examination, Shaw explained\\n\\nthat State Farm found the damages to be related to the theft based on Grandpre\\u2019s statement\\n\\nthat the damages were not present prior to Raver\\u2019s week-long possession. With regard to\\n\\nthe replaced engine, Shaw explained:\\n\\n       So it basically came down to, you know, the insured stated that the vehicle\\n       was running fine prior to the vehicle being stolen, and then when it was\\n       recovered, it had issues and when it went to the mechanic, the mechanic\\n       found damage in the engine that was apparently from the seven days while it\\n       was gone.\\n\\nOn redirect, Shaw reiterated State Farm\\u2019s process for attributing the damage to the theft\\u2014\\n\\nthe items were \\u201cinspected, either physically or through documented photos that were\\n\\nsubmitted to [State Farm] . . . and the investigation of the claim determined that the damage\\n\\n                                             3\\n\\fto these items most likely happened during the theft\\u201d based on State Farm\\u2019s lack of any\\n\\nreason to believe the damage did not occur during the theft. Grandpre was not present to\\n\\ntestify to the truck\\u2019s condition before or after the theft.\\n\\n\\u00b66     Raver, who happened to be a mechanic, also testified to his use of the truck and its\\n\\ncondition. He averred that the truck \\u201csat in [his] yard\\u201d and that despite being pulled over\\n\\nwhile driving, he had only taken it five blocks. He testified that nothing was wrong with\\n\\nthe truck and that he would have fixed it if there had been problems. He denied any issues\\n\\nwith the body of the truck other than the rear bumper being \\u201ctied up\\u201d and further denied\\n\\nany damage to the door handle, windshield, lights, or tonneau cover\\u2014all items that had\\n\\nbeen repaired post-theft and attributed to his use. Raver proposed paying $975 for cleaning\\n\\nand rental costs.1\\n\\n\\u00b67     The District Court ordered the State\\u2019s full requested restitution. It found that there\\n\\nwas \\u201ca reasonable and causative connection between the damage to that vehicle, your\\n\\nparticipation in the theft and then use of that vehicle.\\u201d Regarding the laundry list of vehicle\\n\\nrepairs, the District Court stated:\\n\\n       I get it, it\\u2019s an old truck, I get it, the truck had issues. But you know what,\\n       the truck was drivable, and the truck was functioning before you had it. And\\n       then what we hear from the insurance representative, is that when you were\\n       done with it, they had to replace all kinds of parts. And now you are arguing,\\n       well, I didn\\u2019t do that damage, when I had it stolen, and I was using drugs and\\n       I was running around the community stealing copper from Montana Rail\\n       Link, I didn\\u2019t do any damage to the vehicle.\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n  On appeal, Raver concedes that the value of the stolen hunting gear should also be recovered as\\nrestitution. Thus, he now alleges $2,734.99 is the appropriate amount, accounting for the hunting\\ngear, rental car expenses, and cleaning costs.\\n                                               4\\n\\fRaver appeals the amount of restitution based on an asserted lack of causation.\\n\\n                               STANDARD OF REVIEW\\n\\n\\u00b68     We review criminal restitution orders for compliance with \\u00a7\\u00a7 46-18-241\\n\\nthrough -249, MCA.

He asserts that Grandpre\\u2019s victim statement was overly\\n\\nvague and that State Farm\\u2019s investigation was insufficient, and that the District Court erred\\n\\nby finding only \\u201ca reasonable and causative connection\\u201d as opposed to finding causation\\n\\n\\n                                             5\\n\\fby a preponderance of the evidence. Alternatively, Raver argues that the restitution award\\n\\nshould be reduced by the cost of the new bumper because he proved that the bumper had\\n\\ndamage prior to the theft.\\n\\n\\u00b611    Upon criminal sentencing, a district court must require the defendant to pay\\n\\nrestitution in an amount \\u201csufficient to fully compensate victims for all pecuniary loss\\n\\nsubstantiated by record evidence to have been caused by the defendant\\u2019s criminal conduct.\\u201d\\n\\nPierre, \\u00b6 12 (citing \\u00a7\\u00a7 46-18-201(5), -241(1), and -243(1), MCA). This restitution\\n\\nobligation is limited to \\u201cpecuniary victim losses he or she has agreed to pay or that are\\n\\ndirectly or indirectly caused by an offense he or she committed or is criminally\\n\\naccountable.\\u201d Pierre, \\u00b6 12. The required causation can be found \\u201cbetween an offender\\u2019s\\n\\nadmitted or adjudicated criminal conduct and the asserted victim loss, upon an admission,\\n\\nby implication from proof of the elements of the charged offense, upon victim affidavits\\n\\nincluded with a PSI, or upon other evidence presented at or incident to sentencing.\\u201d Pierre,\\n\\n\\u00b6 13. Because restitution is a civil remedy defined by those damages that would be\\n\\navailable in a civil loss, \\u201cthere must be a preponderance of the evidence supporting the\\n\\nrestitution award.\\u201d Aragon, \\u00b6 16.\\n\\n\\u00b612    Raver likens his case to Aragon, Pierre, and Cole, all cases in which we found\\n\\ninsufficient causation between the defendant\\u2019s criminal conduct and the restitution award.\\n\\nEach is distinguishable from the basic credibility determination that supports the District\\n\\nCourt\\u2019s causation conclusion here. In Aragon, the defendant drove his car into the victim\\u2019s\\n\\ngarage and the victim received a restitution award that included the cost of repainting the\\n\\nentire home to match the repainted garage. Aragon, \\u00b6\\u00b6 4, 6. The defendant contested that\\n\\n                                             6\\n\\fit was necessary to repaint the rest of the home. The defendant and the victim presented\\n\\nequally credible conflicting estimates for the repair work, and we reversed, finding that\\n\\nthere was not substantial evidence to support the higher amount because \\u201c[a] reasonable\\n\\nmind could not conclude, solely from the two estimates, that one was more appropriate\\n\\nthan the other.\\u201d Aragon, \\u00b6 19.\\n\\n\\u00b613    In Pierre, the defendant was ordered to pay restitution jointly and severally with\\n\\nco-defendants who had burglarized the main home, guest house, and outbuilding of a\\n\\nproperty, causing $43,294.46 in pecuniary loss. Pierre, \\u00b6 9. The defendant pleaded guilty\\n\\nonly to burgling the guest house. Pierre, \\u00b6 6. He admitted to stealing collectible dolls from\\n\\nthe guest house, but the State otherwise had \\u201cno non-speculative evidence indicating that\\n\\nPierre had in fact entered the main house, otherwise participated in any of the main house\\n\\nburglaries or thefts, or took any affirmative act to aid or abet the others in the commission\\n\\nof those burglaries and thefts.\\u201d Pierre, \\u00b6\\u00b6 5, 8. We reversed based on the complete lack\\n\\nof evidence \\u201csufficient to prove even an indirect causal connection\\u201d between the\\n\\ndefendant\\u2019s criminal conduct and the pecuniary loss arising from burglary to the main\\n\\nhouse. Pierre, \\u00b6 22.\\n\\n\\u00b614    Finally, in Cole, the defendant pleaded guilty to possession of dangerous drugs and\\n\\ndrug paraphernalia after law enforcement discovered methamphetamine and a glass pipe\\n\\nin a bedroom that he resided in at least part-time. Cole, \\u00b6 5. Additional defendants residing\\n\\nin the same apartment were also criminally charged. Cole, \\u00b6 6. Cole pleaded guilty only\\n\\nto the drugs that were found in his room, but the district court ordered Cole to pay\\n\\n$31,902.99 in remediation costs\\u2014an amount that covered the entire apartment, not only\\n\\n                                             7\\n\\fCole\\u2019s room. Cole, \\u00b6\\u00b6 6-8. Again, we reversed, finding that the specific criminal conduct\\n\\nfor which the defendant pleaded guilty was not causally related to the damage done to the\\n\\nrest of the apartment. Cole, \\u00b6\\u00b6 16-17.\\n\\n\\u00b615    Here, Raver\\u2019s crime is more than sufficiently causally connected to the damage. He\\n\\nadmitted to entering, using, and possessing the vehicle for a week; he used and possessed\\n\\nthe entire vehicle; and he makes no supported argument that the damage was caused by\\n\\nsomeone else during the time it was stolen. Raver testified that he neither observed nor\\n\\ncaused any damage, but the District Court did not find his testimony credible. This is not\\n\\nthe situation in Aragon, where the court had two pieces of equally credible conflicting\\n\\nevidence without any other context regarding the discrepancy. This is not Pierre, where\\n\\nthe record was entirely devoid of evidence to suggest that the defendant had even indirectly\\n\\ncaused pecuniary losses arising from the main house burglary. This is not Cole, where the\\n\\ndefendant\\u2019s plea was specifically spatially limited to only damages connected to his room.\\n\\nRather, the District Court was presented with testimony from State Farm and Grandpre\\u2019s\\n\\nvictim statement that it deemed credible and conflicting testimony from Raver that it\\n\\ndeemed not credible. State Farm testified that it investigated normally and concluded that\\n\\nall of the documented damage occurred while the truck was in Raver\\u2019s possession. Based\\n\\non these facts, Grandpre\\u2019s victim statement, and accompanying documentation, the District\\n\\nCourt correctly found that there was a preponderance of the evidence supporting the causal\\n\\nrelationship between Raver\\u2019s theft and the damage to Grandpre\\u2019s truck, even if it did not\\n\\nuse these precise words.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                             8\\n\\f\\u00b616    The implication of Raver\\u2019s argument that State Farm\\u2019s investigation was \\u201cpoor\\u201d is\\n\\na thinly veiled accusation that Grandpre committed insurance fraud and received car repairs\\n\\nthat were necessary regardless of the theft based on the age and mileage of the car. The\\n\\ninner workings of State Farm\\u2019s investigation are not for this Court to opine. What is\\n\\nessential here is that State Farm presented facts of its investigation and conclusions that the\\n\\nDistrict Court found credible and that showed, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the\\n\\ndamage to Grandpre\\u2019s truck was directly or indirectly caused by Raver\\u2019s theft.\\n\\n\\u00b617    We also decline to sever the matter of the rear bumper. Raver\\u2019s alleged proof that\\n\\nthe bumper was irreparably damaged before is a photograph referenced in the hearing but\\n\\nnot part of the record before this Court. Without that photograph, we have only Grandpre\\u2019s\\n\\nstatement as part of the initial police report that the bumper was \\u201ctied with camo string.\\u201d\\n\\nThis is insufficient evidence to refute State Farm\\u2019s conclusion that the bumper was not in\\n\\nan irreparable state before the theft and was in an irreparable state afterwards.\\n\\n                                      CONCLUSION\\n\\n\\u00b618    Affirmed.\\n\\n\\n                                                   /S/ LAURIE McKINNON\\n\\nWe Concur:\\n\\n/S/ KATHERINE M BIDEGARAY\\n/S/ BETH BAKER\\n/S/ INGRID GUSTAFSON\\n/S/ JIM RICE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                              9\\n\\f\",\n",

We review the following restated issue on appeal:\\n\\n          Whether the District Court erred in awarding restitution based on an insurer\\u2019s\\n          testimony that the contested damage was attributable to the defendant\\u2019s theft\\n          and the District Court concluded that the defendant\\u2019s conflicting testimony was\\n          not credible.\\n\\nWe affirm.\\n\\n                 FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\\n\\n\\u00b62    On November 19, 2020, Raver was pulled over after a Yellowstone County deputy\\n\\nobserved him driving a black Ford F-150 confirmed to be a stolen vehicle. Both Raver and\\n\\nhis passenger were arrested at the scene on unrelated outstanding warrants. The truck\\u2019s\\n\\nowner, Stacie Grandpre (Grandpre), confirmed that she did not know Raver and had not\\n\\ngiven him permission to drive her truck. Grandpre gave the deputies consent to search the\\n\\nvehicle. Upon searching, deputies found several syringes and a spoon with a crystalline\\n\\nsubstance, as well as spools of copper wire and tools belonging to Montana Rail Link.\\n\\n\\u00b63    The State charged Raver by Information with six counts, including felony theft\\n\\npursuant to \\u00a7 45-6-301(1), MCA; felony theft pursuant to \\u00a7 45-6-301(3), MCA; and four\\n\\nmisdemeanors for possession of marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia, driving while\\n\\nsuspended, and theft of the copper wire. Pursuant to a plea agreement, Raver entered a no\\n\\ncontest plea for the felony theft under \\u00a7 45-6-301(3) (purposely or knowingly obtaining\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                           2\\n\\fcontrol over property known to have been stolen by another) and misdemeanor theft of the\\n\\ncopper wire, and the rest of the charges were dropped.\\n\\n\\u00b64     Following the theft, the truck underwent extensive repair and replacement work\\n\\nincluding several completely new components; of note, the back bumper was replaced\\n\\ndespite Grandpre\\u2019s original theft report stating that \\u201cthe driver side bumper [was] tied with\\n\\ncamo string.\\u201d In her victim statement, Grandpre also noted the loss and replacement costs\\n\\nof her hunting gear which had been stolen with the truck. She characterized her truck as\\n\\n\\u201cruined.\\u201d In total, the State requested $17,470.36 in restitution, which accounted for\\n\\nGrandpre\\u2019s hunting gear, car rentals, cleaning costs, and vehicle damage as paid by\\n\\nGrandpre\\u2019s insurer. Raver contested this amount.\\n\\n\\u00b65     The District Court heard argument on the restitution issue at the May 17, 2023\\n\\nsentencing hearing. In support of the restitution award, the State presented Cleve Shaw\\n\\n(Shaw), a State Farm Insurance claims specialist. On cross-examination, Shaw explained\\n\\nthat State Farm found the damages to be related to the theft based on Grandpre\\u2019s statement\\n\\nthat the damages were not present prior to Raver\\u2019s week-long possession. With regard to\\n\\nthe replaced engine, Shaw explained:\\n\\n       So it basically came down to, you know, the insured stated that the vehicle\\n       was running fine prior to the vehicle being stolen, and then when it was\\n       recovered, it had issues and when it went to the mechanic, the mechanic\\n       found damage in the engine that was apparently from the seven days while it\\n       was gone.\\n\\nOn redirect, Shaw reiterated State Farm\\u2019s process for attributing the damage to the theft\\u2014\\n\\nthe items were \\u201cinspected, either physically or through documented photos that were\\n\\nsubmitted to [State Farm] . . . and the investigation of the claim determined that the damage\\n\\n                                             3\\n\\fto these items most likely happened during the theft\\u201d based on State Farm\\u2019s lack of any\\n\\nreason to believe the damage did not occur during the theft. Grandpre was not present to\\n\\ntestify to the truck\\u2019s condition before or after the theft.\\n\\n\\u00b66     Raver, who happened to be a mechanic, also testified to his use of the truck and its\\n\\ncondition. He averred that the truck \\u201csat in [his] yard\\u201d and that despite being pulled over\\n\\nwhile driving, he had only taken it five blocks. He testified that nothing was wrong with\\n\\nthe truck and that he would have fixed it if there had been problems.

Raver proposed paying $975 for cleaning\\n\\nand rental costs.1\\n\\n\\u00b67     The District Court ordered the State\\u2019s full requested restitution. It found that there\\n\\nwas \\u201ca reasonable and causative connection between the damage to that vehicle, your\\n\\nparticipation in the theft and then use of that vehicle.\\u201d Regarding the laundry list of vehicle\\n\\nrepairs, the District Court stated:\\n\\n       I get it, it\\u2019s an old truck, I get it, the truck had issues. But you know what,\\n       the truck was drivable, and the truck was functioning before you had it.

He asserts that Grandpre\\u2019s victim statement was overly\\n\\nvague and that State Farm\\u2019s investigation was insufficient, and that the District Court erred\\n\\nby finding only \\u201ca reasonable and causative connection\\u201d as opposed to finding causation\\n\\n\\n                                             5\\n\\fby a preponderance of the evidence. Alternatively, Raver argues that the restitution award\\n\\nshould be reduced by the cost of the new bumper because he proved that the bumper had\\n\\ndamage prior to the theft.\\n\\n\\u00b611    Upon criminal sentencing, a district court must require the defendant to pay\\n\\nrestitution in an amount \\u201csufficient to fully compensate victims for all pecuniary loss\\n\\nsubstantiated by record evidence to have been caused by the defendant\\u2019s criminal conduct.\\u201d\\n\\nPierre, \\u00b6 12 (citing \\u00a7\\u00a7 46-18-201(5), -241(1), and -243(1), MCA). This restitution\\n\\nobligation is limited to \\u201cpecuniary victim losses he or she has agreed to pay or that are\\n\\ndirectly or indirectly caused by an offense he or she committed or is criminally\\n\\naccountable.\\u201d Pierre, \\u00b6 12. The required causation can be found \\u201cbetween an offender\\u2019s\\n\\nadmitted or adjudicated criminal conduct and the asserted victim loss, upon an admission,\\n\\nby implication from proof of the elements of the charged offense, upon victim affidavits\\n\\nincluded with a PSI, or upon other evidence presented at or incident to sentencing.\\u201d Pierre,\\n\\n\\u00b6 13. Because restitution is a civil remedy defined by those damages that would be\\n\\navailable in a civil loss, \\u201cthere must be a preponderance of the evidence supporting the\\n\\nrestitution award.\\u201d Aragon, \\u00b6 16.\\n\\n\\u00b612    Raver likens his case to Aragon, Pierre, and Cole, all cases in which we found\\n\\ninsufficient causation between the defendant\\u2019s criminal conduct and the restitution award.\\n\\nEach is distinguishable from the basic credibility determination that supports the District\\n\\nCourt\\u2019s causation conclusion here. In Aragon, the defendant drove his car into the victim\\u2019s\\n\\ngarage and the victim received a restitution award that included the cost of repainting the\\n\\nentire home to match the repainted garage. Aragon, \\u00b6\\u00b6 4, 6. The defendant contested that\\n\\n                                             6\\n\\fit was necessary to repaint the rest of the home. The defendant and the victim presented\\n\\nequally credible conflicting estimates for the repair work, and we reversed, finding that\\n\\nthere was not substantial evidence to support the higher amount because \\u201c[a] reasonable\\n\\nmind could not conclude, solely from the two estimates, that one was more appropriate\\n\\nthan the other.\\u201d Aragon, \\u00b6 19.\\n\\n\\u00b613    In Pierre, the defendant was ordered to pay restitution jointly and severally with\\n\\nco-defendants who had burglarized the main home, guest house, and outbuilding of a\\n\\nproperty, causing $43,294.46 in pecuniary loss. Pierre, \\u00b6 9. The defendant pleaded guilty\\n\\nonly to burgling the guest house. Pierre, \\u00b6 6. He admitted to stealing collectible dolls from\\n\\nthe guest house, but the State otherwise had \\u201cno non-speculative evidence indicating that\\n\\nPierre had in fact entered the main house, otherwise participated in any of the main house\\n\\nburglaries or thefts, or took any affirmative act to aid or abet the others in the commission\\n\\nof those burglaries and thefts.\\u201d Pierre, \\u00b6\\u00b6 5, 8. We reversed based on the complete lack\\n\\nof evidence \\u201csufficient to prove even an indirect causal connection\\u201d between the\\n\\ndefendant\\u2019s criminal conduct and the pecuniary loss arising from burglary to the main\\n\\nhouse. Pierre, \\u00b6 22.\\n\\n\\u00b614    Finally, in Cole, the defendant pleaded guilty to possession of dangerous drugs and\\n\\ndrug paraphernalia after law enforcement discovered methamphetamine and a glass pipe\\n\\nin a bedroom that he resided in at least part-time. Cole, \\u00b6 5. Additional defendants residing\\n\\nin the same apartment were also criminally charged. Cole, \\u00b6 6. Cole pleaded guilty only\\n\\nto the drugs that were found in his room, but the district court ordered Cole to pay\\n\\n$31,902.99 in remediation costs\\u2014an amount that covered the entire apartment, not only\\n\\n                                             7\\n\\fCole\\u2019s room. Cole, \\u00b6\\u00b6 6-8. Again, we reversed, finding that the specific criminal conduct\\n\\nfor which the defendant pleaded guilty was not causally related to the damage done to the\\n\\nrest of the apartment. Cole, \\u00b6\\u00b6 16-17.\\n\\n\\u00b615    Here, Raver\\u2019s crime is more than sufficiently causally connected to the damage. He\\n\\nadmitted to entering, using, and possessing the vehicle for a week; he used and possessed\\n\\nthe entire vehicle; and he makes no supported argument that the damage was caused by\\n\\nsomeone else during the time it was stolen. Raver testified that he neither observed nor\\n\\ncaused any damage, but the District Court did not find his testimony credible. This is not\\n\\nthe situation in Aragon, where the court had two pieces of equally credible conflicting\\n\\nevidence without any other context regarding the discrepancy. This is not Pierre, where\\n\\nthe record was entirely devoid of evidence to suggest that the defendant had even indirectly\\n\\ncaused pecuniary losses arising from the main house burglary. This is not Cole, where the\\n\\ndefendant\\u2019s plea was specifically spatially limited to only damages connected to his room.\\n\\nRather, the District Court was presented with testimony from State Farm and Grandpre\\u2019s\\n\\nvictim statement that it deemed credible and conflicting testimony from Raver that it\\n\\ndeemed not credible. State Farm testified that it investigated normally and concluded that\\n\\nall of the documented damage occurred while the truck was in Raver\\u2019s possession. Based\\n\\non these facts, Grandpre\\u2019s victim statement, and accompanying documentation, the District\\n\\nCourt correctly found that there was a preponderance of the evidence supporting the causal\\n\\nrelationship between Raver\\u2019s theft and the damage to Grandpre\\u2019s truck, even if it did not\\n\\nuse these precise words.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                             8\\n\\f\\u00b616    The implication of Raver\\u2019s argument that State Farm\\u2019s investigation was \\u201cpoor\\u201d is\\n\\na thinly veiled accusation that Grandpre committed insurance fraud and received car repairs\\n\\nthat were necessary regardless of the theft based on the age and mileage of the car. The\\n\\ninner workings of State Farm\\u2019s investigation are not for this Court to opine. What is\\n\\nessential here is that State Farm presented facts of its investigation and conclusions that the\\n\\nDistrict Court found credible and that showed, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the\\n\\ndamage to Grandpre\\u2019s truck was directly or indirectly caused by Raver\\u2019s theft.\\n\\n\\u00b617    We also decline to sever the matter of the rear bumper. Raver\\u2019s alleged proof that\\n\\nthe bumper was irreparably damaged before is a photograph referenced in the hearing but\\n\\nnot part of the record before this Court. Without that photograph, we have only Grandpre\\u2019s\\n\\nstatement as part of the initial police report that the bumper was \\u201ctied with camo string.\\u201d\\n\\nThis is insufficient evidence to refute State Farm\\u2019s conclusion that the bumper was not in\\n\\nan irreparable state before the theft and was in an irreparable state afterwards.\\n\\n                                      CONCLUSION\\n\\n\\u00b618    Affirmed.\\n\\n\\n                                                   /S/ LAURIE McKINNON\\n\\nWe Concur:\\n\\n/S/ KATHERINE M BIDEGARAY\\n/S/ BETH BAKER\\n/S/ INGRID GUSTAFSON\\n/S/ JIM RICE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                              9\\n\\f</pre>\",\n",
